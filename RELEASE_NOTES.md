- **Structural Purpose Only**: Lines only exist where they serve meaningful structural purposes
- **Smart Start/End Points**: Lines can start/end at canvas boundaries OR closest tile edges
- **Light Gray Styling**: All grid lines use light gray color (`#D3D3D3`) for subtle appearance
- **Minimum Segment Length**: Only substantial segments (>40px) are kept to avoid visual clutter

### üè∑Ô∏è Pathway ID Management
- **Toggle Control**: Added sidebar checkbox to show/hide pathway ID labels
- **Default Off**: Pathway IDs are now hidden by default for cleaner small-view appearance
- **Regular Font**: Changed from bold "Arial Black" to regular "Arial" font for better readability
- **Universal Control**: Toggle works across all visualization modes (canvas, full-size, detailed views)

### üñ±Ô∏è Enhanced Click Functionality
- **Direct Tile Interaction**: Click directly on pathway tiles (no separate buttons needed)
- **Full-Screen Activation**: Clicking any tile automatically opens full-screen detailed view of the entire dataset
- **Simplified Hover**: Hover shows pathway name + "Click for full-screen view" hint
- **Session State Management**: Proper state tracking for detailed view navigation
