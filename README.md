# Mondrian Abstraction and Language Model Embeddings for Differential Pathway Analysis

**Project Overview:**

This repository contains supplementary file, codebase and data generated for our paper titled "Mondrian Abstraction and Language Model Embeddings for Differential Pathway Analysis" which is currently under peer-review in a bioinformatics conference.

**Supplementary File:** The supplementary file to our paper can be found [here](https://github.com/aimed-lab/mondrian-map/blob/main/supplementary-file.pdf).

**Code:** The `notebooks` folder contains the following jupyter notebooks:

1. **clinical_data_analysis.ipynb**: Notebook for analyzing clinical data and suitable patient profile selection.
2. **data_preperation.ipynb**: Notebook for preprocessing data to make it suitable for Mondrian Map Visualization.
3. **pathway_embeddings.ipynb**: Here, we've experimented with different embedding techniques with different prompting strategies.
3. **visualize_mondrian_map.ipynb**: In this notebook, we've generated the Mondrian Maps in our Gliblastoma case study.

**Data:** All the datasets used and processed are stored in the `data` folder.
