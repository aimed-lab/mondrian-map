The purpose of this model is to serve as an overview of research in this field and recommend new candidates for more focused or genome wide analyses. SIDS is the sudden and unexpected death of an infant (less than 1 year of age), almost always during deep sleep, where no cause of death can be found by autopsy. Factors that mediate SIDS are likely to be both biological and behavioral, such as sleeping position, environment and stress during a critical phase of infant development (http://www.nichd.nih.gov/health/topics/Sudden_Infant_Death_Syndrome.cfm). While no clear diagnostic markers currently exist, several polymorphisms have been identified which are significantly over-represented in distinct SIDS ethnic population. The large majority of these polymorphisms exist in genes associated with neuronal signaling, cardiac contraction and inflammatory response. These and other lines of evidence suggest that SIDS has a strong autonomic nervous system component (PMID:12350301, PMID: 20124538). One of the neuronal nuclei most strongly implicated in SIDS has been the raphe nucleus of the brain stem. In this nuclei there are ultrastructural, cellular and molecular changes associated with SIDS relative to controls (PMID:19342987, PMID: 20124538). This region of the brain is responsible for the large majority of neuronal serotonin produced and is functionally important in the regulation of normal cardiopulmonary activity, sleep and thermoregulation (see associated references).\n\nGenes associated with serotonin synthesis and receptivity have some of the strongest genetic association with SIDS. Principle among these genes the serotonin biosynthetic enzyme TPH2, the serotonin transporter SLC6A4 and the serotonin receptor HTR1A. SLC6A4 exhibits decreased expression in the raphe nucleus of the medulla oblongata and polymorphisms specifically associated with SIDS (PMID:19342987). In 75% of infants with SIDS, there is decreased HTR1A expression relative to controls along with an increase in the number of raphe serotonin neurons (PMID:19342987). Over-expression of the mouse orthologue of the HTR1A gene in the juvenile mouse medulla produces an analogous phenotype to SIDS with death due to bradycardia and hypothermia (PMID:18599790). These genes as well as those involved in serotonin synthesis are predicted to be transcriptionally regulated by a common factor, FEV (human orthologue of PET-1). PET-1 knock-out results in up to a 90% loss of serotonin neurons (PMID:12546819), while polymorphisms in FEV are over-represented in African American infants with SIDS. In addition to FEV, other transcription factors implicated in the regulation of these genes (Putative transcriptional regulators (TRs)) and FEV are also listed (see associated references). In addition to serotonin, vasopressin signaling and its regulation by serotonin appear to be important in a common pathway of cardiopulmonary regulation (PMID:2058745). A protein that associates with vasopressin signaling, named pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (ADCYAP1), results in a SIDS like phenotype, characterized by a high increase in spontaneous neonatal death, exacerbated by hypothermia and hypoxia (PMID:14608012), when disrupted in mice. Protein for this gene is widely distributed throughout the central nervous system (CNS), including autonomic control centers (PMID:12389210). ADCYAP1 and HTR1A are both predicted to be transcriptionally regulated by REST promoter binding. Regulation of G-protein coupled signaling pathways is illustrated for these genes, however, it is not clear whether ADCYAP1 acts directly upon raphe serotonin neurons. \n\nAnother potentially important class of receptors in SIDS is nicotine. Receptors for nicotine are expressed in serotonin neurons of the raphe throughout development (PMID:18986852).  Application of nicotine or cigarette smoke is sufficient to inhibit electrical activity of raphe serotonin neurons (PMID:17515803) and chronic nicotine infusion in rats decreases expression of SLC6A4 (PMID:18778441). Furthermore, nicotine exposure reduces both HTR1A and HTR2A immunoreactivity in several nuclei of the brainstem (PMID:17451658).\n\nIn addition to CNS abnormalities, several studies have identified a critical link between cardiac arrhythmia (long QT syndrome) and SIDS (PMID:18928334). A number of genetic association studies identified functionally modifying mutations in critical cardiac channels in as many as 10% of all SIDS cases (PMID:18928334). These mutations have been predicted to predispose infants for long QT syndrome and sudden death. The highest proportion of SIDS associated mutations (both inherited and sporadic) is found in the sodium channel gene SCN5A. Examination of putative transcriptional regulators for these genes, highlights a diverse set of factors as well as a relatively common one (SP1).\n\nFinally, several miscellaneous mutations have been identified in genes associated with inflammatory response and thermoregulation. Infection is considered a significant risk factor for SIDS (PMID:19114412). For inflammatory associated genes, such as TNF alpha, interleukin 10 and complement component 4, many of these mutations are only significant in the presence of infection and SIDS. In addition to these mutations, cerebrospinal fluid levels of IL6 are increased in SIDS cases as well as IL6R levels in the arcuate nucleus of the brain, another major site of serotonin synthesis (PMID:19396608). Genes such as ILR6 and ADCYAP1 are also associated with autoimmune disorders, thus SIDS may also be associated with autoinflammation of autonomic centers in the brain. Regulation of thermogenesis by brown adipose tissue has been proposed be an important component of SIDS, given that SIDS incidence is highest in the winter time and that animal models of SIDS demonstrate variation in body temperature. Interestingly, activation of raphe HTR1A decreases both shivering and peripheral vasoconstriction in piglets (18094064). Although a putative significant polymorphism was identified in the thermoregulator gene HSP60, this only occurred in one SIDS case. It is important to note that in the large majority of all these studies, sleeping position and smoking were among the most significant risk factors for SIDS. \n\nIn loving memory of Milo Salomonis (http://www.milosalomonis.org). \n\nProteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP706 CPTAC Assay Portal].", "Cell Type": "brown adipocyte && serotonergic neuron && raphe nuclei neuron && cardiac myocyte", "Disease": "SIDS", "Pathway Ontology": "disease pathway && serotonin signaling pathway", "Summary": "Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is the sudden and unexpected death of an infant under one year of age, often occurring during deep sleep, with no identifiable cause of death.

Complement C3 belongs to the alpha-2-macroglobulin family of proteins, and consists of a alpha-chain and an beta-chain. Cleavage of C3 which can be initiated by one or more of the above three distinct pathways, into C3b[Proteolysis@23-667,749-1663] and C3a [Proteolysis@672-748] is an important step in the complement activation cascade. Classical and lectin pathways, when activated with recognition of pathogens (or immune complexes) use C3-convertase [C4b2a] to cleave complement C3 into C3a and C3b [https://doi.org/10.1084/jem.125.2.359]. However, in alternative pathway a small fraction of the C3 molecules are hydrolyzed to C3(H20) exposing new binding sites. This hydrated C3 [C3(H20)] recruits complement factor B [fB], which is then cleaved by complement factor D [fD] to result in formation of the minor form of C3-convertase [C3(H20)Bb] that cleaves C3 into C3a and C3b [https://doi.org/10.1084/jem.154.3.856].

It was found to be expressed by a variety of cell types including macrophages, dendritic cell subsets, B cells, several T-cell subpopulations including Th2 and T-regulatory cells (Tregs) and Natural Killer (NK) cells (Moore et al. 2001). It is now recognized that the biological effects of IL10 are directed at antigen-presenting cells (APCs) such as macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs), its effects on T-cell development and differentiation are largely indirect via inhibition of macrophage/dendritic cell activation and maturation (Pestka et al. 2004, Mocellin et al. 2004). T cells are thought to be the main source of IL10 (Hedrich & Bream 2010). IL10 inhibits a broad spectrum of activated macrophage/monocyte functions including monokine synthesis, NO production, and expression of class II MHC and costimulatory molecules such as IL12 and CD80/CD86 (de Waal Malefyt et al. 1991, Gazzinelli et al. 1992). Studies with recombinant cytokine and neutralizing antibodies revealed pleiotropic activities of IL10 on B, T, and mast cells (de Waal Malefyt et al. 1993, Rousset et al. 1992, Thompson-Snipes et al. 1991) and provided evidence for the in vivo significance of IL10 activities (Ishida et al. 1992, 1993). IL10 antagonizes the expression of MHC class II and the co-stimulatory molecules CD80/CD86 as well as the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL1Beta, IL6, IL8, TNFalpha and especially IL12 (Fiorentino et al. 1991, D'Andrea et al. 1993). The biological role of IL10 is not limited to inactivation of APCs, it also enhances B cell, granulocyte, mast cell, and keratinocyte growth/differentiation, as well as NK-cell and CD8+ cytotoxic T-cell activation (Moore et al. 2001, Hedrich & Bream 2010). IL10 also enhances NK-cell proliferation and/or production of IFN-gamma (Cai et al. 1999).  <br><br>IL10-deficient mice exhibited inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and other exaggerated inflammatory responses (Kuhn et al. 1993, Berg et al. 1995) indicating a critical role for IL10 in limiting inflammatory responses. Dysregulation of IL10 is linked with susceptibility to numerous infectious and autoimmune diseases in humans and mouse models (Hedrich & Bream 2010). <br><br>IL10 signaling is initiated by binding of homodimeric IL10 to the extracellular domains of two adjoining IL10RA molecules. This tetramer then binds two IL10RB chains. IL10RB cannot bind to IL10 unless bound to IL10RA (Ding et al. 2001, Yoon et al. 2006); binding of IL10 to IL10RA without the co-presence of IL10RB fails to initiate signal transduction (Kotenko et al. 1997).<br><br>IL10 binding activates the receptor-associated Janus tyrosine kinases, JAK1 and TYK2, which are constitutively bound to IL10R1 and IL10R2 respectively. In the classic model of receptor activation assembly of the receptor complex is believed to enable JAK1/TYK2 to phosphorylate and activate each other. Alternatively the binding of IL10 may cause conformational changes that allow the pseudokinase inhibitory domain of one JAK kinase to move away from the kinase domain of the other JAK within the receptor dimer-JAK complex, allowing the two kinase domains to interact and trans-activate (Waters & Brooks 2015).<br><br>The activated JAK kinases phosphorylate the intracellular domains of the IL10R1 chains on specific tyrosine residues. These phosphorylated tyrosine residues and their flanking peptide sequences serve as temporary docking sites for the latent, cytosolic, transcription factor, STAT3. STAT3 transiently docks on the IL10R1 chain via its SH2 domain, and is in turn tyrosine phosphorylated by the receptor-associated JAKs. Once activated, it dissociates from the receptor, dimerizes with other STAT3 molecules, and translocates to the nucleus where it binds with high affinity to STAT-binding elements (SBEs) in the promoters of IL-10-inducible genes (Donnelly et al. 1999).\n View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=6783783 Reactome].", "Summary": "Interleukin-10 (IL10) plays a crucial role in regulating immune responses by inhibiting the activation and maturation of antigen-presenting cells, such as macrophages and dendritic cells.

This binding activates the receptor-associated Janus tyrosine kinases, JAK1 and TYK2, leading to the phosphorylation and activation of STAT3, a transcription factor that regulates the expression of IL-10-inducible genes."}, "WAG003024": {"NAME": "Endochondral ossification", "LINK": "https://www.wikipathways.org/index.php/Pathway:WP474", "WP_ID": "WP474", "Description": "Endochondral ossification is the process by which the embryonic cartilaginous model of most bones contributes to longitudinal growth and is gradually replaced by bone. During endochondral ossification, chondrocytes proliferate, undergo hypertrophy and die; the cartilage extracellular matrix they construct is then invaded by blood vessels, osteoclasts, bone marrow cells and osteoblasts, the last of which deposit bone on remnants of cartilage matrix. The sequential changes in chondrocyte behaviour are tightly regulated by both systemic factors and locally secreted factors, which act on receptors to effect intracellular signalling and activation of chondrocyte-selective transcription factors. Systemic factors that regulate the behaviour of chondrocytes in growth cartilage include growth hormone and thyroid hormone, and the local secreted factors include Indian hedgehog, parathyroid hormone-related peptide, fibroblast growth factors and components of the cartilage extracellular matrix. Transcription factors that play critical roles in regulation of chondrocyte gene expression under the control of these extracellular factors include Runx2, Sox9 and MEF2C. The invasion of cartilage matrix by the ossification front is dependent on its resorption by members of the matrix metalloproteinase family, as well as the presence of blood vessels and bone-resorbing osteoclast (Mackie et al.)\n\nThyroid hormone and especially triiodothyronine induce morphological hypertrophy of chondrocytes, through binding to thyroid hormone receptors. Further, triiodothyronine increases the total collagen production in chondrocytes, as also terminal differentiation, but triiodothyronine also induces cell death through non-apoptotic modes of physiological death. Triiodothyronine acts by altering intracellular gene expression after receptor binding, and is crucial for growth, as receptor deficiencies lead to dwarfism and growth retardation. Thyroid hormone inhibits the PTHR1 gene, which encodes for a g-protein coupled receptor for parathyroid hormone (PTH) and PTH-like hormones. PTH receptors activate adenylyl cyclase and a phosphatidylinositol-calcium second messenger system. They control the levels of calcium in the blood and thus, ossification as they inhibit hypertrophy upon activation (Mackie, Randau, https://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/jansen-type-metaphyseal-chondrodysplasia/ ).\nOxygen acts upon RUNX2 and HDAC4 in the ossification process. HDAC4 is a class II histone deacetylase/acuc/apha family gene, and if tethered to a promoter, it represses transcription (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/9759). Via this mechanism, HDAC4 represses RUNX2 in the ossification process. RUNX2 is a member of the RUNX family of transcription factors, encoding a nuclear protein with an RUND DNA-binding domain. It induces osteoblastic differentiation and skeletal morphogenesis, as it acts upon the DNA and regulatory factors (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/860). Thus, RUNX2 acts directly upon chondrocytical hypertrophy. \nCyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) act upon protein kinase A (PKA), which phosphorylates proteins if activated. In this case it leads to the inhibition of Sox9 (https://www.nature.com/articles/nm.3314). Sox9 induces cell proliferation and inhibits hypertrophy and is regulating the transcription of the anti-m\u00c3\u00bcllerian hormone.\n\nProteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP474 CPTAC Assay Portal]", "Cell Type": "osteochondroclast && osteoclast && chondrocyte", "Pathway Ontology": "regulatory pathway", "Summary": "Endochondral ossification is a complex biological process by which the embryonic cartilaginous model of most bones is gradually replaced by bone, allowing for longitudinal growth.

GABA is synthesized by two distinct enzymes, GAD67 and GAD65, which differ in their cellular localization, functional properties, and co-factor requirements. GABA synthesized by GAD65 is primarily used for neurotransmission, while GABA synthesized by GAD67 is involved in processes such as synaptogenesis and neuronal protection. GABA is loaded into synaptic vesicles with the help of the vesicular inhibitory amino acid transporter, VGAT, and is released upon the arrival of an action potential at the presynaptic bouton, facilitated by the opening of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. The release of GABA in the synaptic cleft triggers binding to GABA receptors, initiating post-ligand binding events.

Listeria monocytogenes enters the body through the gastrointestinal tract after ingestion of contaminated food. The bacteria can survive food preservation procedures, such as refrigeration, low pH and high salt.<br>Listeria monocytogenes expresses several adhesin proteins at the cell surface that facilitate bacterial binding and entry to host cells. The bacteria can enter host cells through endocytosis mediated by binding of the bacterial InlA (internalin) protein to CDH1 (E-cadherin) at the host cell plasma membrane. Listeria monocytogenes can also enter host cells through endocytosis mediated by binding of the bacterial InlB protein to MET receptor tyrosine kinase at the host cell plasma membrane. Listeria monocytogenes proliferates inside the host cells and triggers formation of filopods, elongated protrusions of the host plasma membrane that contain bacteria. Filopods are ingested by adjacent cells, allowing Listeria monocytogenes to spread from cell to cell, invisible to the immune system of the host.<br>Listeria monocytogenes can cross the intestinal, blood-brain and placental barriers.

In infants infected in utero and in immunocompromised adults Listeria monocytogenes infection can result in meningoencephalitis and bacteremia (sepsis).<br>InlA is critical for crossing the intestinal barrier while both InlA and InlB are needed for crossing the placental barrier (Gessain et al. 2015) and, based on in vitro studies, the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier (Grundler et al. 2013). It seems that the intrinsic level of PI3K activity in Listeria-targeted host cells determines whether the entry depends on InlA only or InlA and InlB. The interaction of InlA with E-cadherin does not activate PI3K/AKT signaling while the interaction of InlB with the MET receptor activated the PI3K/AKT signal transduction cascade. Therefore, InlB-MET interaction may be important in tissues with low intrinsic PI3K activity (Gessain et al. 2015).

(1) The storage form of cholesterol, known as cholesteryl ester, is formed through an ester bond between a fatty acid carboxylate group and the hydroxyl group of cholesterol. (1) \n\nCholesterol is essential for the maintenance of stability within animal cell membranes and acts as a precursor for the biosynthesis of Vitamin D and bile acids. (3) It is also necessary for the synthesis of pregnenolone, which in turn, is a precursor for all steroid hormones- including glucocorticoids, estrogens, progesterones,  androgens and aldosterone. (3) Another key role of cholesterol is within neuronal physiology; it is essential for synapse and dendrite development, and forms a major component of myelin. (4)  \n\n        Biosynthesis and regulation \n\nGiven the essentiality of cholesterol in the body, all cells are capable of its biosynthesis from acetyl-CoA via a complex, multistep process occurring in the endoplasmic reticulum and cytosolic compartments. (1) Generally, over half the cholesterol in the body (approximately 700 mg/d) arises thorough this endogenous biosynthesis, with 20% of this cholesterol being synthesised in the liver and intestine. (1) The remainder is sourced from the consumption of animal-derived foods in the diet. (1) Regulation cholesterol biosynthesis relies on cholesterol levels within the cell. (6)\n\nMaintaining cellular lipid homeostasis is critical for cell survival and homeostatic disturbances may lead to disease. (7) \n- Membrane bound transcription factors SREBPs (sterol regulatory element binding proteins) regulate de novo cholesterol synthesis. Two genes in the human genome encode 3 SREBP isoforms: SREBP-1a, SREBP 1c/ADD1 and SREBP-2. (6) Activation of SREBPs and thus the biosynthesis of cholesterol is mediated by SCAP (SREBP cleavage activating protein), which acts as a cholesterol sensor in the cell. (6) \n\n- In cholesterol-replete cells, SREBP is bound to SCAP, forming the SREBP-SCAP complex. (6) The complex is bound to Insig, a resident protein on the endoplasmic reticulum whose expression is induced by insulin. (6) Through this sequestration of the SREBP-SCAP complex to the endoplasmic reticulum, cholesterol biosynthesis is inhibited. (6)\n\n- When SCAP senses depleted cholesterol levels within the cell, the SCAP-SREBP complex dissociates from Insig, and moves towards the Golgi apparatus. (6) Two proteolytic cleavage events, mediated by site 1 (S1P) and site 2 (S2P) proteases that are activated by SCAP in low-cholesterol environments, enable the the release of SREBP from the membrane. (6)\n\n- Released SREBP travels to the nucleus and binds to sterol regulatory element (SRE) sequences in target gene promotor regions to stimulate their transcription. (6) Target genes include low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor and HMG-CoA reductase. (6) The former plays a key role in scavenging low-density lipoproteins (primary cholesterol carriers) in the blood, while the latter is necessary for endogenous cholesterol synthesis. (6) At the synthesis level, HMG-CoA may also inhibit cholesterol production if the sterol-sensing domain of the enzyme detects cholesterol levels to be high. (6) This is mediated by the sterol-regulated binding of HMG-CoA to Insig, which promotes the enzyme's ubiquitylation and proteosomal degredation. (6) \n\n         Transport \n\nCholesterol, predominately in its esterified form, is transported between tissues in lipoproteins. (1) Lipoproteins facilitate the transport of cholesterol and cholesteryl esters via emulsification; i.e. the spherical lipoprotein unit contains a nonpolar core of cholesteryl esters and triglycerides, surrounded by an amphiphathic layer of phospholipids, apoproteins and small amounts of non-esterified cholesterol. (7) \n\nDifferent types of lipoproteins are classified according to their increasing levels of density. (botham) These include chylomicrons, very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), intermediate density lipoprotein (IDL), low density lipoprotein (LDL) and high density lipoprotein (HDL). (7) One or more apolipoproteins (known as Apo A, Apo B, Apo C etc.) are present in each lipoprotein, and contribute to the differentiation, structure and enzymatic activity of the various lipoproteins. (botham) Apolipoproteins also act as ligands for the binding of lipoproteins to tissue lipoprotein receptors, which facilitates the uptake of lipids by cells. (1)\n\nDietary cholesterol and other lipids, including free fatty acids and triglycerides, are packaged in chylomicrons for transport out of the intestine. (7) Ultimately, triglycerides are transferred to muscle and adipose tissue, and this is followed by the transfer of cholesterol to the liver via chylomicron remnants. (7) Chylomicron remnants, high in cholesteryl esters, are formed following the removal of the lipoprotein\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u201e\u00a2s triglyceride core. (7) The uptake of chylomicron remnants by the liver is facilitated by the binding of Apo E to specific receptors located only on hepatic cells. (7) In the liver, chylomicron remnants are catabolised by lysosomes, leading to the liberation of cholesterol; this cholesterol may either be excreted from the body via bile acids, or incorporated into VLDL for transport alongside biosynthesised cholesterol to peripheral tissues. (7) In the circulation, VLDL is eventually converted into remnant VLDL particles, then into LDL particles, which are cholesterol rich and contain approximately 75% of all plasma cholesterol. (7) It is LDL particles that ultimately bind to specific LDL tissue receptors to provide a supply of cholesterol to peripheral tissues. (6) Such tissues include the adrenal glands, skeletal muscle, lymphocytes, gonads and kidneys.

The MECP2 gene locus consists of four exons. Both exon 1 and exon 2 contain translation start sites. Alternative splicing of the second exon results in expression of two MECP2 transcript isoforms, MECP2_e1 (MECP2B or MECP2alpha) and MECP2_e2 (MECP2A or MECP2beta). The N-terminus of the MECP2_e1 isoform, in which exon 2 is spliced out, is encoded by exon 1. The N-terminus of the MECP2_e2 isoforms, which includes both exon 1 and exon 2, is encoded by exon 2, as the exon 2 translation start site is used. Exons 3 and 4 are present in both isoforms. The MECP2_e2 isoform was cloned first and is therefore more extensively studied. The MECP2_e1 isoform is more abundant in the brain (Mnatzakanian et al. 2004, Kriaucionis and Bird 2004, Kaddoum et al. 2013). Mecp2 isoforms show different expression patterns during mouse brain development and in adult brain regions (Dragich et al. 2007, Olson et al. 2014). While Rett syndrome mutations mainly occur in exons 3 and 4 of MECP2, thereby affecting both MECP2 isoforms (Mnatzakanian et al. 2004), some mutations occur in exon 1, affecting MECP2_e1 only. No mutations have been described in exon 2 (Gianakopoulos et al. 2012). Knockout of Mecp2_e1 isoform in mice, through a naturally occurring Rett syndrome point mutation which affects the first translation codon of MECP2_e1, recapitulates Rett-like phenotype. Knockout of Mecp2_e2 isoform in mice does not result in impairment of neurologic functions (Yasui et al. 2014). In Mecp2 null mice, transgenic expression of either Mecp2_e1 or Mecp2_e2 prevents development of Rett-like phenotype, with Mecp2_e1 rescuing more Rett-like symptoms than Mecp2_e2. This indicates that both splice variants can fulfill basic Mecp2 functions in the mouse brain (Kerr et al. 2012). Changes in gene expression upon over-expression of either MECP2_e1 or MECP2_e2 imply overlapping as well as distinct target genes (Orlic-Milacic et al. 2014).<p>Methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 encoded by the MECP2 gene binds to methylated CpG sequences in the DNA. The binding is not generic, however, but is affected by the underlying DNA sequence (Yoon et al. 2003). MECP2 binds to DNA containing 5 methylcytosine (5mC DNA), a DNA modification associated with transcriptional repression (Mellen et al. 2012), both in the context of CpG islands and outside of CpG islands (Chen et al. 2015). In addition, MECP2 binds to DNA containing 5 hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC DNA), a DNA modification associated with transcriptional activation (Mellen et al. 2012). MECP2 binds to DNA as a monomer, occupying about 11 bp of the DNA. Binding of one MECP2 molecule facilitates binding of the second MECP2 molecule, and therefore clustering can occur at target sites. MECP2 binding to chromatin may be facilitated by nucleosome methylation (Ghosh et al. 2010).<p>MECP2 was initially proposed to act as a generic repressor of gene transcription. However, high throughput studies of MECP2-induced changes in gene expression in mouse hippocampus (Chahrour et al. 2008), and mouse and human cell lines (Orlic-Milacic et al. 2014) indicate that more genes are up-regulated than down-regulated when MECP2 is overexpressed. At least for some genes directly upregulated by MECP2, it was shown that a complex of MECP2 and CREB1 was involved in transcriptional stimulation (Chahrour et al. 2008, Chen et al. 2013).<p>MECP2 expression is the highest in postmitotic neurons compared to other cell types, with MECP2 being almost as abundant as core histones. Phosphorylation of MECP2 in response to neuronal activity regulates binding of MECP2 to DNA, suggesting that MECP2 may remodel chromatin in a neuronal activity-dependent manner. The resulting changes in gene expression would then modulate synaptic plasticity and behavior (reviewed by Ebert and Greenberg 2013). In human embryonic stem cell derived Rett syndrome neurons, loss of MECP2 is associated with a significant reduction in transcription of neuronally active genes, as well as the reduction in nascent protein synthesis. The reduction in nascent protein synthesis can at least in part be attributed to the decreased activity of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. Neuronal morphology (reduced soma size) and the level of protein synthesis in Rett neurons can be ameliorated by treating the cells with growth factors which activate the PI3K/AKT/mTOR cascade or by inhibition of PTEN, the negative regulator of AKT activation. Mitochondrial gene expression is also downregulated in Rett neurons, which is associated with a reduced capacity of the mitochondrial electron transport chain (Ricciardi et al. 2011, Li et al. 2013). Treatment of Mecp2 null mice with IGF1 (insulin-like growth factor 1) reverses or ameliorates some Rett-like features such as locomotion, respiratory difficulties and irregular heart rate (Tropea et al. 2009).<p>MECP2 regulates expression of a number of ligands and receptors involved in neuronal development and function. Ligands regulated by MECP2 include BDNF (reviewed by Li and Pozzo-Miller 2014, and KhorshidAhmad et al. 2016), CRH (McGill et al. 2006, Samaco et al. 2012), SST (Somatostatin) (Chahrour et al. 2008), and DLL1 (Li et al. 2014). MECP2 also regulates transcription of genes involved in the synthesis of the neurotransmitter GABA \u00e2\u20ac\u201c GAD1 (Chao et al. 2010) and GAD2 (Chao et al. 2010, He et al. 2014). MECP2 may be involved in direct stimulation of transcription from the GLUD1 gene promoter, encoding mitochondrial glutamate dehydrogenase 1, which may be involved in the turnover of the neurotransmitter glutamate (Livide et al. 2015). Receptors regulated by MECP2 include glutamate receptor GRIA2 (Qiu et al. 2012), NMDA receptor subunits GRIN2A (Durand et al. 2012) and GRIN2B (Lee et al. 2008), opioid receptors OPRK1 (Chahrour et al. 2008) and OPRM1 (Hwang et al. 2009, Hwang et al. 2010, Samaco et al. 2012), GPRIN1 (Chahrour et al. 2008), MET (Plummer et al. 2013), NOTCH1 (Li et al. 2014). Channels/transporters regulated by MECP2 include TRPC3 (Li et al. 2012) and SLC2A3 (Chen et al. 2013). MECP2 regulates transcription of FKBP5, involved in trafficking of glucocorticoid receptors (Nuber et al. 2005, Urdinguio et al. 2008). MECP2 is implicated in regulation of expression of SEMA3F (semaphorin 3F) in mouse olfactory neurons (Degano et al. 2009). In zebrafish, Mecp2 is implicated in sensory axon guidance by direct stimulation of transcription of Sema5b and Robo2 (Leong et al. 2015). MECP2 may indirectly regulate signaling by neuronal receptor tyrosine kinases by regulating transcription of protein tyrosine phosphatases, PTPN1 (Krishnan et al. 2015) and PTPN4 (Williamson et al. 2015).<p>MECP2 regulates transcription of several transcription factors involved in functioning of the nervous system, such as CREB1, MEF2C, RBFOX1 (Chahrour et al. 2008) and PPARG (Mann et al. 2010, Joss-Moore et al. 2011).<p>MECP2 associates with transcription and chromatin remodeling factors, such as CREB1 (Chahrour et al. 2008, Chen et al. 2013), the HDAC1/2-containing SIN3A co-repressor complex (Nan et al. 1998), and the NCoR/SMRT complex (Lyst et al. 2013, Ebert et al. 2013). There are contradictory reports on the interaction of MECP2 with the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex (Harikrishnan et al. 2005, Hu et al. 2006). Interaction of MECP2 with the DNA methyltransferase DNMT1 has been reported, with a concomitant increase in enzymatic activity of DNMT1 (Kimura and Shiota 2003).<p>In addition to DNA binding-dependent regulation of gene expression by MECP2, MECP2 may influence gene expression by interaction with components of the DROSHA microprocessor complex and the consequent change in the levels of mature microRNAs (Cheng et al. 2014, Tsujimura et al. 2015).<p>Increased MECP2 promoter methylation is observed in both male and female autism patients (Nagarajan et al. 2008). Regulatory elements that undergo methylation are found in the promoter and the first intron of MECP2 and their methylation was shown to regulate Mecp2 expression in mice (Liyanage et al. 2013). Mouse Mecp2 promoter methylation was shown to be affected by stress (Franklin et al. 2010).<p>The Rett-like phenotype of Mecp2 null mice is reversible (Guy et al. 2007), but appropriate levels of Mecp2 expression need to be achieved (Alvarez-Saavedra et al. 2007). When Mecp2 expression is restored in astrocytes of Mecp2 null mice, amelioration of Rett symptoms occurs, involving non-cell-autonomous positive effect on mutant neurons and increasing level of the excitatory glutamate transporter VGLUT1 (Lioy et al. 2011). Microglia derived from Mecp2 null mice releases higher than normal levels of glutamate, which has toxic effect on neurons. Increased glutamate secretion may be due to increased levels of glutaminase (Gls), involved in glutamate synthesis, and increased levels of connexin-32 (Gjb1), involved in glutamate release, in Mecp2 null microglia (Maezawa and Jin 2010).

The MECP2 gene locus consists of four exons, and alternative splicing results in two isoforms, MECP2_e1 and MECP2_e2, which have distinct expression patterns in the brain. MECP2 binds to methylated CpG sequences in DNA, and its binding is influenced by the underlying DNA sequence. MECP2 was initially thought to act as a generic repressor of gene transcription, but high-throughput studies have shown that it can also upregulate gene expression, particularly in the context of neuronal development and function. MECP2 regulates the expression of numerous genes involved in neuronal development and function, including ligands and receptors involved in synaptic plasticity and behavior. MECP2 also interacts with various transcription and chromatin remodeling factors, and its expression is influenced by epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation. Loss-of-function mutations in MECP2 are associated with Rett syndrome, a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by intellectual disability, seizures, and motor dysfunction. Overexpression of MECP2, similar to MECP2 duplication syndrome, can also cause a neurologic phenotype similar to Rett syndrome.

When resting T cells are antigen-activated and expand in response to Interleukin-2 (IL2), they can differentiate as Type 1 (Th1) or Type 2 (Th2) T helper cells. The outcome is influenced by IL4. Th2 cells secrete IL4, which both stimulates Th2 in an autocrine fashion and acts as a potent B cell growth factor to promote humoral immunity (Nelms et al. 1999). <br><br>Interleukin-13 (IL13) is an immunoregulatory cytokine secreted predominantly by activated Th2 cells. It is a key mediator in the pathogenesis of allergic inflammation. IL13 shares many functional properties with IL4, stemming from the fact that they share a common receptor subunit. IL13 receptors are expressed on human B cells, basophils, eosinophils, mast cells, endothelial cells, fibroblasts, monocytes, macrophages, respiratory epithelial cells, and smooth muscle cells, but unlike IL4, not T cells. Thus IL13 does not appear to be important in the initial differentiation of CD4 T cells into Th2 cells, rather it is important in the effector phase of allergic inflammation (Hershey et al. 2003).\n\nIL4 and IL13 induce \u00e2\u20ac\u0153alternative activation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of macrophages, inducing an anti-inflammatory phenotype by signaling through IL4R alpha in a STAT6 dependent manner. This signaling plays an important role in the Th2 response, mediating anti-parasitic effects and aiding wound healing (Gordon & Martinez 2010, Loke et al. 2002)\n\nThere are two types of IL4 receptor complex (Andrews et al. 2006). Type I IL4R (IL4R1) is predominantly expressed on the surface of hematopoietic cells and consists of IL4R and IL2RG, the common gamma chain. Type II IL4R (IL4R2) is predominantly expressed on the surface of nonhematopoietic cells, it consists of IL4R and IL13RA1 and is also the type II receptor for IL13. (Obiri et al. 1995, Aman et al. 1996, Hilton et al. 1996, Miloux et al. 1997, Zhang et al. 1997). The second receptor for IL13 consists of IL4R and Interleukin-13 receptor alpha 2 (IL13RA2), sometimes called Interleukin-13 binding protein (IL13BP). It has a high affinity receptor for IL13 (Kd = 250 pmol/L) but is not sufficient to render cells responsive to IL13, even in the presence of IL4R (Donaldson et al. 1998). It is reported to exist in soluble form (Zhang et al. 1997) and when overexpressed reduces JAK-STAT signaling (Kawakami et al. 2001). It's function may be to prevent IL13 signalling via the functional IL4R:IL13RA1 receptor. IL13RA2 is overexpressed and enhances cell invasion in some human cancers (Joshi & Puri 2012).<br><br>The first step in the formation of IL4R1 (IL4:IL4R:IL2RB) is the binding of IL4 with IL4R (Hoffman et al. 1995, Shen et al. 1996, Hage et al. 1999). This is also the first step in formation of IL4R2 (IL4:IL4R:IL13RA1). After the initial binding of IL4 and IL4R, IL2RB binds (LaPorte et al. 2008), to form IL4R1. Alternatively, IL13RA1 binds, forming IL4R2. In contrast, the type II IL13 complex (IL13R2) forms with IL13 first binding to IL13RA1 followed by recruitment of  IL4R (Wang et al. 2009).<br><br>Crystal structures of the IL4:IL4R:IL2RG, IL4:IL4R:IL13RA1 and IL13:IL4R:IL13RA1 complexes have been determined (LaPorte et al. 2008). Consistent with these structures, in monocytes IL4R is tyrosine phosphorylated in response to both IL4 and IL13 (Roy et al. 2002, Gordon & Martinez 2010) while IL13RA1 phosphorylation is induced only by IL13 (Roy et al. 2002, LaPorte et al. 2008) and IL2RG phosphorylation is induced only by IL4 (Roy et al. 2002).<br><br>Both IL4 receptor complexes signal through Jak/STAT cascades. IL4R is constitutively-associated with JAK2 (Roy et al. 2002) and associates with JAK1 following binding of IL4 (Yin et al. 1994) or IL13 (Roy et al. 2002). IL2RG constitutively associates with JAK3 (Boussiotis et al. 1994, Russell  et al. 1994). IL13RA1 constitutively associates with TYK2 (Umeshita-Suyama et al. 2000, Roy et al. 2002, LaPorte et al. 2008, Bhattacharjee et al. 2013). <br><br>IL4 binding to IL4R1 leads to phosphorylation of JAK1 (but not JAK2) and STAT6 activation (Takeda et al. 1994, Ratthe et al. 2007, Bhattacharjee et al. 2013). <br><br>IL13 binding increases activating tyrosine-99 phosphorylation of IL13RA1 but not that of IL2RG. IL4 binding to IL2RG leads to its tyrosine phosphorylation (Roy et al. 2002). IL13 binding to IL4R2 leads to TYK2 and JAK2 (but not JAK1) phosphorylation (Roy & Cathcart 1998, Roy et al. 2002).<br><br>Phosphorylated TYK2 binds and phosphorylates STAT6 and possibly STAT1 (Bhattacharjee et al. 2013).  <br><br>A second mechanism of signal transduction activated by IL4 and IL13 leads to the insulin receptor substrate (IRS) family (Kelly-Welch et al. 2003). IL4R1 associates with insulin receptor substrate 2 and activates the PI3K/Akt and Ras/MEK/Erk pathways involved in cell proliferation, survival and translational control. IL4R2 does not associate with insulin receptor substrate 2 and consequently the PI3K/Akt and Ras/MEK/Erk pathways are not activated (Busch-Dienstfertig & Gonz\u00c3\u00a1lez-Rodr\u00c3\u00adguez 2013).\n View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=6785807 Reactome].", "Summary": "Interleukin-4 (IL4) and Interleukin-13 (IL13) are crucial immunoregulatory cytokines involved in the immune response, particularly in allergy and asthma.

ECM remodeling is involved in the regulation of cell differentiation processes such as the establishment and maintenance of stem cell niches, branching morphogenesis, angiogenesis, bone remodeling, and wound repair. Redundant mechanisms modulate the expression and function of ECM modifying enzymes. Abnormal ECM dynamics can lead to deregulated cell proliferation and invasion, failure of cell death, and loss of cell differentiation, resulting in congenital defects and pathological processes including tissue fibrosis and cancer.<br><br>Collagen is the most abundant fibrous protein within the ECM constituting up to 30% of total protein in multicellular animals.

Collagen propeptides are cotranslationally translocated into the ER lumen. Propeptides undergo a number of post-translational modifications. Proline and lysine residues may be hydroxylated by prolyl 3-, prolyl 4- and lysyl hydroxylases. 4-hydroxyproline is essential for intramolecular hydrogen bonding and stability of the triple helical collagenous domain. In fibril forming collagens approximately 50% of prolines are 4-hydroxylated; the extent of this and of 3-hydroxyproline and lysine hydroxylation varies between tissues and collagen types (Kivirikko et al. 1972, 1992). Hydroxylysine molecules can form cross-links between collagen molecules in fibrils, and are sites for glycosyl- and galactosylation. Collagen peptides all have non-collagenous domains; collagens within the subclasses have common chain structures. These non-collagenous domains have regulatory functions; some are biologically active when cleaved from the main peptide chain. Fibrillar collagens all have a large triple helical domain (COL1) bordered by N and C terminal extensions, called the N and C propeptides, which are cleaved prior to formation of the collagen fibril. The C propeptide, also called the NC1 domain, is highly conserved. It directs chain association during intracellular assembly of the procollagen molecule from three collagen propeptide alpha chains (Hulmes 2002). The N-propeptide has a short linker (NC2) connecting the main triple helix to a short minor one (COL2) and a globular N-terminal region NC3. NC3 domains are variable both in size and the domains they contain.<br><br>Collagen propeptides typically undergo a number of post-translational modifications.

Prolyl 4-hydroxylase may also have a role in alpha chain association as no association of the C-propeptides of type XII collagen was seen in the presence of prolyl 4-hydroxylase inhibitors (Mazzorana et al. 1993, 1996). In fibril forming collagens approximately 50% of prolines are 4-hydroxylated; the extent of this is species dependent, lower hydroxylation correlating with lower ambient temperature and thermal stability (Cohen-Solal et al. 1986, Notbohm et al. 1992). Similarly the extent of 3-hydroxyproline and lysine hydroxylation varies between tissues and collagen types (Kivirikko et al. 1992). Hydroxylysine molecules can form cross-links between collagen molecules in fibrils, and are sites for glycosyl- and galactosylation.<br><br>Collagen molecules fold and assemble through a series of distinct intermediates (Bulleid 1996). Individual collagen polypeptide chains are translocated co-translationally across the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Intra-chain disulfide bonds are formed within the N-propeptide, and hydroxylation of proline and lysine residues occurs within the triple helical domain (Kivirikko et al. 1992). When the peptide chain is fully translocated into the ER lumen the C-propeptide folds, the conformation being stabilized by intra-chain disulfide bonds (Doege and Fessler 1986). Pro alpha-chains associate via the C-propeptides (Byers et al. 1975, Bachinger et al. 1978), or NC2 domains for FACIT family collagens (Boudko et al. 2008) to form an initial trimer which can be stabilized by the formation of inter-chain disulfide bonds (Schofield et al. 1974, Olsen et al. 1976), though these are not a prerequisite for further folding (Bulleid et al. 1996). The triple helix then nucleates and folds in a C- to N- direction. The association of the individual chains and subsequent triple helix formation are distinct steps (Bachinger et al. 1980). The N-propeptides associate and in some cases form inter-chain disulfide bonds (Bruckner et al., 1978). Procollagen is released via carriers into the exracellular space (Canty & Kadler 2005). Fibrillar procollagens undergo removal of the C- and N-propeptides by procollagen C and N proteinases respectively, both Zn2+ dependent metalloproteinases. Propeptide processing is a required step for normal collagen I and III fibril formation, but collagens can retain some or all of their non-collagenous propeptides. Retained collagen type V and XI N-propeptides contribute to the control of fibril growth by sterically limiting lateral molecule addition (Fichard et al. 1995). Processed fibrillar procollagen is termed tropocollagen, which is considered to be the unit of higher order fibrils and fibres. Tropocollagens of the fibril forming collagens I, II, III, V and XI sponteneously aggregate in vitro in a manner that has been compared with crystallization, commencing with a nucleation event followed by subsequent organized aggregation (Silver et al. 1992, Prockop & Fertala 1998).

Epithelium will result in the placode, which will give origin to most of the layers of the HF. Then, mesenchyme results in the dermal condensate, which thereafter becomes the dermal papilla.\n\nThe first signal for induction is given by mesenchymal cells expressing WNT. Activation of Wnt signalling pathway blocks \u03b2-catenin degradation fate, releasing this transcription factor to start expression of placode formation genes. Between them are MYC, SP5, DKK4, SHH, EDA and EDAR.\n\nMYC is related to the differentiation and proliferation of keratinocytes and stem cells migration. SP5 is capable of inhibiting expression of KRT10 and IVL, both associated with epidermal differentiation fate. As a consequence, they may be suppressed to promote placode formation.\n\nDkk molecules have inhibitory effects against Lrp5 and 6, which are crucial co-receptors in the activation of Wnt pathway. Dkk4 acts as Wnt pathway negative feedback loop, fine-tuning this signalling effects on placode shape.\n\nSHH expression starts in the induction stage and is also upregulated by Wnt pathway in HF epithelium. Its signal activates Shh signaling pathway in the mesenchyme activating Gli, which induces expression of Ptch, increasing cell sensibility to Shh.\nWnt pathway is able to increase EDA expression, whereas Eda pathway does not affect Wnt signal levels. EDAR is a direct Wnt target, and Activin A acts as another upregulator. Furthermore, the Eda-Edar interaction activates NF-kappaB, which upregulates a considerable number of genes, including SHH, DKK4, WNT genes as WNT10A and WNT10B, FOXI3, FGF20, CTGF and FST. WNT10A and WNT10B proteins activate the Wnt pathway in the mesenchymal cells, where released \u03b2-catenin activates expression of other Wnts and further upregulates its own expression, maintaining the tissue crosstalk and enhancing the signaling pathway performance.\n\nOnce the placode has started forming, Eda/NF-kappaB pathway has an important role in guiding cell proliferation. NF-kappaB and Activin A upregulates FOXI3, which has roles in skin appendages shape formation and possibly in placode shape patterning.

Although cells have mechanisms to destroy ROS and repair the damage caused by ROS, it is considered to be a major factor in age-related diseases and the ageing process (Zhang & Weissbach 2008, Kim et al. 2014). ROS-scavenging systems include enzymes such as peroxiredoxins, superoxide dismutases, catalases and glutathione peroxidases exist to minimise the potential damage. <br><br>ROS reactions can also cause specific modifications to amino acid side chains that result in structural changes to proteins/enzymes. Methionine (Met) and cysteine (Cys) can be oxidised by ROS to sulfoxide and further oxidised to sulfone derivatives. Both free Met and protein-based Met are readily oxidized to form methionine sulphoxide (MetO) (Brot & Weissbach 1991). Many proteins have been demonstrated to undergo such oxidation and as a consequence have altered function (Levine et al. 2000). Sulphoxide formation can be reversed by the action of the methionine sulphoxide reductase system (MSR) which catalyses the reduction of MetO to Met (Brot et al. 1981). This repair uses one ROS equivalent, so MSR proteins can act as catalytic antioxidants, removing ROS (Levine et al. 1996). Methionine oxidation results in a mixture of methionine (S)-S- and (R)-S-oxides of methionine, diastereomers which are reduced by MSRA and MSRB, respectively. MSRA can reduce both free and protein-based methionine-(S)-S-oxide, whereas MSRB is specific for protein-based methionine-(R)-S-oxide. Mammals typically have only one gene encoding MSRA, but at least three genes encoding MSRBs (Hansel et al. 2005). Although structurally distinct, MRSA and MRSB share a common three-step catalytic mechanism. In the first step, the MSR catalytic cysteine residue interacts with the MetO substrate, which leads to product release and formation of the sulfenic acid. In the second step, an intramolecular disulfide bridge is formed between the catalytic cysteine and the regenerating cysteine. In the final step, the disulfide bridge is reduced by an electron donor, the NADPH-dependent thioredoxin/TR system, leading to the regeneration of the MSR active site (Boschi-Muller et al. 2008).<br><br>Beta-linked isoaspartyl (isoAsp) peptide bonds can arise spontaneously via succinimide-linked deamidation of asparagine (Asn) or dehydration of aspartate (Asp).

Primed neutrophils actively secrete cytokines and other inflammatory mediators, and can present antigens via MHC II, stimulating T-cells. Granules form during neutrophil differentiation, with subtypes distinguished by their content, but sharing similarities in structure and composition. The classical granule subsets include Azurophil, secondary, and gelatinase granules, as well as storage vesicles formed by endocytosis, which contain cell-surface markers and extracellular proteins.

Angiogenesis is mediated by the coordinated action of a variety of growth factors, metabolites and cell adhesion molecules in endothelial cells [4-6]. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is the principal angiogenic growth factor modulating neovascularization [7].\n\nThe biological effect of VEGF is mediated through specific VEGF receptors on endothelial cell surface. VEGFs (VEGF-A, VEGF-B, VEGF-C and VEGF-D) interact with VEGF receptors such as VEGFR1, VEGFR2 and VEGFR3. Among them, VEGFA/VEGFR2 signaling appears to mediate cellular responses involved in angiogenesis prominently. Further, VEGF/VEGFR1 signaling, though weak, converges to VEGFR2 signaling pathway. VEGFA binding to VEGFR2 at the surface of endothelial cells leads to dimerization and auto-phosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic domain of VEGFR2. It leads to activation of multiple downstream signaling cascades and promotes endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and tube formation relevant to angiogenesis [8]. VEGFR2 dependent activation of PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling regulates cell survival, cell proliferation, anti-apoptotic and cell permeability functions [9]. Another important pathway of VEGF mediated cell proliferation appears to be through PLC\u00ce\u00b3-mediated activation of PKC and downstream induction of the ERK and other PKC-dependent pathways [10]. Endothelial cell migration is induced by VEGFA/VEGFR2 signaling through activation of p38MAPK (actin polymerization) and FAK (focal adhesion turnover) which is particularly important in directed migration. Phosphosite specificity towards downstream signalling has also been documented. Phosphosite mapping documented seven phosphosites in VEGFR2 receptor: Y1054, Y1214, Y801, Y1175, Y951, Y1059 and Y996. Phosphorylation of Y1214 and Y1054 regulates signaling events involved in cell migration. Y801 phosphorylation regulates cell survival. Y1175 regulates both cell proliferation and migration. Y951 and Y1059 phosphorylation regulates cell survival, cell migration and cell proliferation.\n\nVEGFA/VEGFR2 signaling network compiles data available in the literature with respect to VEGFA signaling (especially VEGFA-165) through VEGFR2 in endothelial cells. The signaling events involving these proteins were derived from experimentally validated data involving multiple experimental techniques and approaches. Individual signaling events in VEGFR2 signaling networks leading to cell proliferation, migration and survival were identified and categorized into protein-protein interactions, enzyme-catalyzed events, activation/inhibition reactions, transport of protein across subcellular compartments, and gene regulation events. Signaling molecules involved in VEGFA/VEGFR2 signaling were categorized to enzymes, receptors and transcription factors and the contextual activation/deactivation of these molecules downstream to VEGFA/ VEGFR2 signaling, in modulating angiogenesis, is documented.\n\nVEGFA dependent angiogenesis pathway map depicts the integration of signaling pathways regulating cell survival, cell migration, cell proliferation, cellular interactions downstream of VEGFA/VEGFR2 signaling relevant to angiogenesis, regulation of VEGFR2, phosphosite specificity of VEGFR2 towards downstream signaling, post-translational modifications, molecular function-based information, cross-talks among proteins in the canonical signaling modules and the information on the compartmentalization of proteins. The map of VEGFA/VEGFR2 signaling network is interactive to help investigators to add new information as it becomes available in the future for analysis or representation.\n\n\nVEGFA dependent angiogenesis pathway map may please be cited as:\n \n1.

An early study in 1999 revealed that about 50% of the proteins in the Swiss-Prot database at the time were N-glycosylated (Apweiler et al. 1999). It is now established that the majority of the proteins in the secretory pathway require glycosylation in order to achieve proper folding.<br>The addition of an N-glycan to a protein can have several roles (Shental-Bechor & Levy 2009). First, glycans enhance the solubility and stability of the proteins in the ER, the golgi and on the outside of the cell membrane, where the composition of the medium is strongly hydrophilic and where proteins, that are mostly hydrophobic, have difficulty folding properly. Second, N-glycans are used as signal molecules during the folding and transport process of the protein: they have the role of labels to determine when a protein must interact with a chaperon, be transported to the golgi, or targeted for degradation in case of major folding defects. Third, and most importantly, N-glycans on completely folded proteins are involved in a wide range of processes: they help determine the specificity of membrane receptors in innate immunity or in cell-to-cell interactions, they can change the properties of hormones and secreted proteins, or of the proteins in the vesicular system inside the cell.<br>All N-linked glycans are derived from a common 14-sugar oligosaccharide synthesized in the ER, which is attached co-translationally to a protein while this is being translated inside the reticulum. The process of the synthesis of this glycan, known as Synthesis of the N-glycan precursor or LLO, constitutes one of the most conserved pathways in eukaryotes, and has been also observed in some eubacteria. The attachment usually happens on an asparagine residue within the consensus sequence asparagine-X-threonine by an complex called oligosaccharyl transferase (OST).<br>After being attached to an unfolded protein, the glycan is used as a label molecule in the folding process (also known as Calnexin/Calreticulin cycle) (Lederkremer 2009). The majority of the glycoproteins in the ER require at least one glycosylated residue in order to achieve proper folding, even if it has been shown that a smaller portion of the proteins in the ER can be folded without this modification.<br>Once the glycoprotein has achieved proper folding, it is transported via the cis-Golgi through all the Golgi compartments, where the glycan is further modified according to the properties of the glycoprotein. This process involves relatively few enzymes but due to its combinatorial nature, can lead to several millions of different possible modifications. The exact topography of this network of reactions has not been established yet, representing one of the major challenges after the sequencing of the human genome (Hossler et al. 2006).<br>Since N-glycosylation is involved in an great number of different processes, from cell-cell interaction to folding control, mutations in one of the genes involved in glycan assembly and/or modification can lead to severe development problems (often affecting the central nervous system).

TGF-\u03b2 ligands belong to a large superfamily of cytokines that bears its name (TGF-\u03b2 Superfamily) and includes bone morphogenic proteins, activins, inhibin, growth/differentiation factors, Mullerian inhibiting substance, Nodal, and several other structurally-related polypeptides. Mammals express three TGF-\u03b2 isoforms (i.e., TGF-\u03b21, TGF-\u03b22, and TGF-\u03b23) that are encoded by distinct genes in a tissue-specific and developmentally-regulated manner. TGF-\u03b2 was identified originally via its stimulation of morphological transformation and anchorage-independent growth in fibroblasts; however, this cytokine is now recognized as being a potent tumor suppressor that prevents the dysregulated growth and survival of epithelial, endothelial, and hematopoietic cells. In addition, numerous studies have clearly established TGF-\u03b2 as a multifunctional cytokine that plays essential roles in regulating virtually all aspects of mammalian development and differentiation, and in maintaining mammalian tissue homeostasis. The pleiotropic nature of TGF-\u03b2 is highlighted by the fact that every cell in the metazoan body can produce and respond to this cytokine. Even more remarkably, malignant cells have evolved a variety of complex mechanisms capable of circumventing the tumor suppressing activities of TGF-\u03b2, and in doing so, typically convert the functions of TGF-\u03b2 to that of a tumor promoter, particularly the induction of carcinoma epithelial-mesenchymal transition, invasion, and dissemination to distant organ sites. This peculiar conversion in TGF-\u03b2 function is known as the \"TGF-\u03b2 Paradox\", which underlies the lethality of TGF-\u03b2 in metastatic cancer cells. Thus, elucidating the effectors and signaling modules activated by TGF-\u03b2 may offer new insights into the development of novel neoadjuvants capable of effectively targeting the TGF-\u03b2 pathway to significantly improve the clinical course of patients with cancer, fibrosis, or immunologic disorders. TGF-\u03b2 is secreted from cells as a latent homodimeric polypeptide that becomes tethered to the extracellular matrix by latent-TGF-\u03b2-binding proteins. Mature TGF-\u03b2 isoforms are activated and liberated from extracellular matrix depots by a variety of mechanisms, including proteolysis, reactive oxygen species, changes in pH, and physical interactions with integrins, thromobspondin-1, or SPARC. Once activated, mature TGF-\u03b2 initiates transmembrane signaling by binding to two distinct transmembrane Ser/Thr protein kinases, termed TGF-\u03b2 type I (T\u03b2R-I) and type II (T\u03b2R-II) receptors. In some cells and tissues, TGF-\u03b2 also binds to a third cell surface receptor, TGF-\u03b2 type III (T\u03b2R-III), which transfers TGF-\u03b2 to T\u03b2R-II and T\u03b2R-I. Full activation of these cytokine:receptor ternary complexes transpires upon T\u03b2R-II-mediated transphosphorylation and activation of T\u03b2R-I, which then phosphorylates and activates the latent transcription factors, Smad2 and Smad3. Afterward, phosphorylated Smad2/3 interact physically with Smad4, with the resulting heterotrimers translocating into the nucleus to regulate the expression of TGF-\u03b2-responsive genes. These Smad-dependent events are subject to fine-tuning and crosstalk regulation in the cytoplasm by their interaction with a variety of adapter molecules, including SARA, Hgs, PML and Dab2, and with Smad7, whose inhibitory activity is modulated by STRAP, AMSH2, and Arkadia; and in the nucleus by their interaction with a variety of transcriptional activators and repressors that occur in a gene- and cell-specific manner. In addition to activating canonical Smad2/3-dependent signaling, accumulating evidence clearly links the development of a variety of human pathologies to aberrant coupling of TGF-\u03b2 to its noncanonical effector molecules.

Action potentials are generated by the movement of ions through transmembrane ion channels in cardiac cells. Like skeletal myocytes (and axons), in the resting state, a given cardiac myocyte has a negative membrane potential. In both muscle types, after a delay (the absolute refractory period), K+ channels reopen and the resulting flow of K+ out of the cell causes repolarisation. The voltage-gated Ca2+ channels on the cardiac sarcolemma membrane are generally triggered by an influx of Na+ during phase 0 of the action potential. Cardiac muscle cells are so tightly bound that when one of these cells is excited the action potential spreads to all of them. The standard model used to understand the cardiac action potential is the action potential of the ventricular myocyte (Park & Fishman 2011, Grant 2009).<br><br>The action potential has 5 phases (numbered 0-4). Phase 4 describes the membrane potential when a cell is not being stimulated. The normal resting potential in the ventricular myocardium is between -85 to -95 mV. The K+ gradient across the cell membrane is the key determinant in the normal resting potential. Phase 0 is the rapid depolarisation phase in which electrical stimulation of a cell opens the closed, fast Na+ channels, causing a large influx of Na+ creating a Na+ current (I<sub>Na+</sub>). This causes depolarisation of the cell. The slope of phase 0 represents the maximum rate of potential change and differs in contractile and pacemaker cells. Phase 1 is the inactivation of the fast Na+ channels. The transient net outward current causing the small downward deflection (the \"notch\" of the action potetial) is due to the movement of K+ and Cl- ions. In pacemaker cells, this phase is due to rapid K+ efflux and closure of L-type Ca2+ channels. Phase 2 is the plateau phase which is sustained by a balance of Ca2+ influx and K+ efflux. This phase sustains muscle contraction. Phase 3 of the action potential is where a concerted action of two outward delayed currents brings about repolarisation back down to the resting potential (Bartos et al. 2015).\n View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=5576891 Reactome].", "Pathway Ontology": "regulatory pathway", "Summary": "The cardiac action potential is a complex process that controls the contraction of the heart by regulating the sequence of atrial and ventricular activation.

Each molecule of EIF2AK1 binds two molecules of heme, one bound near the N-terminus and one bound at the kinase insert (KI) domain that inhibits the kinase activity of EIF2AK1 (inferred from the rabbit homolog in Chefalo et al. 1998, Rafie-Kolpin et al. 2000, inferred from the mouse homolog in Misanova et al. 2006, Hirai et al. 2007, Igarashi et al. 2008).

It may lead to dramatic manifestations such as proteinuria, hypoaluminemia, and hypertension. Also, there are many inheritable genetic abnormalities that can cause podocyte damage of FSGS caused by mutations in proteins that are important for podocyte function. The genes include CD2AP, MYO1E, WNT1, and LAMB2.\nOn the far left, the diagram illustrates molecular interactions between a normal podocyte and matrix interactions. ACTN4 and SYNPO and DAG1 interacting with AGRN associate with the actin cytoskeleton; these actin associated proteins might play a role in maintaining podocyte and GBM architecture. DAG1 binds to UTRN, which in turn binds an actin filament, thus completing the link between the actin-based cytoskeleton and the extracellular matrix. Podocyte foot processes are anchored to the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) via ITGB1 and ITGA3 integrin complex and DAG1-UTRN complex.

Research over past two decades have implicated the role of AGEs in most of the age-related diseases like Alzheimer's disease, cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, renal disorders, hypertension, stroke, visual impairment and skin disorders. AGEs also modify the skin collagen and accelerates the aging process. In diabetic patients, AGE formation occurs in large scale and manifests with clinical symptoms such as cataract, atherosclerosis, nephropathy and neuropathy.\n\nAGEs are known to bind with different cell surface receptors such as receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), dolichyldiphosphooligosaccharide-protein glycosyltransferase (AGE-R1), protein kinase C substrate, 80KH phosphoprotein (AGE-R2), galectin-3 (AGE-R3), and class A macrophage scavenger receptor types I and II.  RAGE, is the well-studied receptor for AGEs and the signaling events mediated by others are either not been identified or are considered as negative regulators of RAGE signaling. RAGE is an integral membrane protein of the immunoglobulin superfamily. RAGE is constituted of an extracellular domain, a transmembrane domain and a short cytoplasmic domain. RAGE is expressed in a wide range of tissues such as lung, heart, kidney, brain, skeletal muscles, and in different types of cells including endothelial cells, macrophages/monocytes, neutrophils, and lymphocytes. Besides AGEs, RAGE also mediate the effects of its other extracellular ligands namely extracellular high mobility group box-1 (HMGB1), S100 family of calcium binding proteins and amyloid-beta peptide, among many others. Although a large number of advanced glycation end products have been identified in humans, AGE/RAGE signaling ex-vivo is mostly studied using the AGEs such as AGE-modified albumin, N(6)(carboxymethyl)lysine, N(6)(carboxyethyl)lysine and pentosidine.\n\nThe signaling events mediated by RAGE are complex due to the diversity of its ligands and their effects in different cell types. Homodimerization of RAGE has been identified to be essential for RAGE signaling. Depending on the intensity and duration of RAGE ligation, specific signaling modules such as ERK1/2, p38 MAPK, CDC42/RAC, SAPK/JNK and NF-\u03baB has been shown to be regulated in different cell types. AGEs have been shown to induce the formation of complexes containing RAGE with DIAPH1, SRC/IRS1/PKC-alpha, TIRAP/MYD88/IRAK4 and RHOA. RAGE-DIAPH1 interaction is required for the activation of RAC1/CDC42 pathway leading to neurite outgrowth and regulation of cytoskeleton.Activation of PKC-alpha through RAGE/SRC/IRS1/PKC-alpha by AGEs has been suggested as a mechanism of insulin resistance in skeletal muscle cells. RAGE also shares the adaptor molecules such as TIRAP, MYD88 and IRAK4 of toll-like receptors and induce the activation of AKT, p38MAPK and NFKB pathways. AGEs have also been shown to induce the formation of complex between RAGE and RHOA. RHOA/ROCK dependent phosphorylation of ezrin/radixin/moesin (ERM) is required for the regulation of gap formation and actin reorganization, and thereby endothelial permeability. However, in tubular cells, AGEs inhibit phosphorylation of ERMs leading to inhibition of tubulogenesis. Similarly, AKT have been shown to be activated by AGEs and induce proliferation of primary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells where as phosphorylation of AKT is shown to be inhibited in podocytes leading to FOXO4 activation and apoptosis. The major component of AGE/RAGE signaling is the oxidative stress induced pathways. AGEs induce the oxidative stress through the activation of NADPH oxidases.

All PAKs share a conserved catalytic domain located at the carboxyl terminus and a highly conserved motif in the amino terminus known as p21-binding domain (PBD) or Cdc42/Rac interactive binding (CRIB) domain. There are six mammalian PAKs that can be divided into two classes: class I (or conventional) PAKs (PAK1-3) and class II PAKs (PAK4-6). Conventional PAKs are important regulators of cytoskeletal dynamics and cell motility and are additionally implicated in transcription through MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) cascades, death and survival signaling and cell cycle progression (Chan and Manser 2012).<p>PAK1, PAK2 and PAK3 are direct effectors of RAC1 and CDC42 GTPases. RAC1 and CDC42 bind to the CRIB domain.

Despite the relatively simple structure of the collagen triple helix, the biosynthesis of type I procollagen is extremely complex, involving multiple steps and requiring an ensemble of proteins for post-translational modifications, folding, transport, secretion and quality control. The COL1A1 and COL1A2 transcripts are translated in the rough endoplasmic reticulum (rER), and the \u03b1(I)\u2011chains undergo a series of post-translational modifications. Helical prolines in position Y of the Gly-Xaa-Yaa repeat are hydroxylated in position C4 by prolyl 4\u2011hydroxylase 1 (P4H1), whereas specific prolines in the X positions are 3\u2011hydroxylated by P3H1 and P3H2. Some lysine residues are hydroxylated by lysyl hydroxylases (LH1 and LH2, encoded by PLOD1 and PLOD2 respectively), and glycosylation of hydroxylysines into galactosyl-hydroxylysine and glucosyl-galactosyl-hydroxylysine is catalysed by procollagen galactosyltransferase 1 and procollagen glucosyltransferase 1. After synthesis of the carboxy-terminal propeptide, it forms intra-chain disulfide bonds and remains attached to the rER membrane. Selection and association of the correct chains into a triple helix occur by diffusion of the C-propeptides attached to the rER membrane. A nucleus for triple helix formation is formed that staggers the chains in the correct order and initiates triple helix formation. Protein disulfide isomerase catalyses inter-chain disulfide bond formation, which stabilize the folding nucleus. Hydroxylation of proline residues and some lysine residues continues and triple helix formation proceeds from the C-terminal end towards the amino-terminal end. During this phase, 65 kDa FK506\u2011binding protein (FKBP65; encoded by FKBP10) and a complex formed by P3H1 \u2014 CRTAP\u2013 PPIase B (peptidyl-prolyl cis\u2013trans isomerase B) \u2014 seem to play a crucial part. The complex is involved in the Hydroxylation of proline 986 of the collagen \u03b11(I)-chain and \u03b11(II)-chain and proline 707 of the \u03b12(I)-chain, which are thought to be important for supramolecular assembly of collagen fibrils and to serve as binding sites for chaperones or small leucine-rich proteoglycans. Beyond its prolyl 3\u2011hydroxylase activity, the complex functions as a PPIase and chaperone for collagen folding. Indeed, the fast propagation of the triple helix requires the isomerization of cis peptide bonds that convert proline residues into trans configuration, mainly by PPIase B24. When most of the helix is folded, the N-propeptides associate and form the small triple helix within this domain. The newly formed triple helix is stabilized by serpin H1 (also known as HSP47; encoded by SERPINH1) and FKBP65. Further modifications occur during transport from the rER to the Golgi apparatus in special coat protein complex vesicles that contain melanoma inhibitory activity protein 3 (also known as TANGO1, encoded by MIA) and through the Golgi stack by cisternal maturation. Serpin H1 also has binding sites along the helical portion of the molecule and assists shuttling of folded collagen into the cis-Golgi. These biosynthetic steps depend on a proper rER environment (for example, optimal calcium levels and redox potential), and the quality-control mechanisms can lead to the activation of the unfolded protein response using the ER-associated degradation pathway or the autophagy-mediated lysosomal degradation system to eliminate molecules that were not properly folded. Once secreted, the propeptides of procollagen are cleaved by a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs 2 (ADAMTS2) and bone morphogenetic protein 1 (BMP1) into mature type I collagen. This initiates collagen fibre formation and these fibrils are stabilized by crosslink formation, in which certain lysine and hydroxylysine residues in the triple helix and the  telopeptides are oxidized by lysyl oxidases and converted into allysine and hydroxyallysine. These residues then initially form divalent crosslinks that convert into mature trivalent pyridinoline and pyrrole crosslinks to stabilize the fibril structure in tissues.\n\nBone formation consists of the secretion of bone extracellular matrix components (mainly type I collagen) by osteoblasts. The unmineralized bone matrix (osteoid) subsequently becomes mineralized. In addition, osteoblasts and osteocytes release many cytokines, including receptor activator of nuclear factor-\u03baB ligand (RANKL; also known as TNFSF11) and osteoprotegerin (OPG, encoded by TNFRSF11B), which regulate bone resorption by osteoclasts. RANKL acts on osteoclast precursor cells by binding to receptor activator of nuclear factor-\u03baB (RANK; also known as TNFRSF11A) on their surface, thereby favouring their differentiation to osteoclasts. OPG, by interacting with RANKL, prevents the binding of RANKL to RANK. Some osteoblasts become embedded in the mineralized bone matrix and differentiate to osteocytes, which produce, among other factors, sclerostin, an inhibitor of the WNT pathway that is known to stimulate bone formation by stimulating osteoblast activity.\n\nLinked with a dotted arrow to the GeneProduct nodes are diseases caused by mutation in the respective gene.\n\nAdapted from [5]", "Disease": "osteogenesis imperfecta", "Pathway Ontology": "disease pathway", "Summary": "Type I collagen synthesis is a complex process involving multiple steps and requiring an ensemble of proteins for post-translational modifications, folding, transport, secretion, and quality control.

MBL and ficolins interact with MBL-associated serine proteases (MASP) leading to cleavage of C4 and C2 and formation of the classical C3 convertase, C4bC2a. The alternative pathway is spontaneously activated by the hydrolysis of the internal thioester group of C3 to give C3(H2O). Alternative pathway activation involves interaction of C3(H2O) and/or previously generated C3b with factor B, which is cleaved by factor D to generate the alternative C3 convertases C3(H2O)Bb and/or C3bBb. All three pathways merge at the proteolytic cleavage of component C3 by C3 convertases to form opsonin C3b and anaphylatoxin C3a. C3b covalently binds to glycoproteins scattered across the target cell surface. This is followed by an amplification reaction that generates additional C3 convertases and deposits more C3b at the local site. C3b can also bind to C3 convertases switching them to C5 convertases, which mediate C5 cleavage leading to MAC formation. Thus, the activation of the complement system leads to several important outcomes:  opsonization of target cells to enhance phagocytosis, lysis of target cells via membrane attack complex (MAC) assembly on the cell surface, production of anaphylatoxins C3a/C5a involved in the host inflammatory response, C5a-mediated leukocyte chemotaxis, and clearance of antibody-antigen complexes. The complement system is able to distinguish between pathological and physiological challenges, i.e. the outcomes of complement activation are predetermined by the trigger and are tightly tuned by a combination of initiation events with several regulatory mechanisms. These regulatory mechanisms use soluble (e.g., C4BP, CFI and CFH) and membrane-bound regulators (e.g., CR1, CD46(MCP), CD55(DAF) and CD59) and are coordinated by complement receptors such as CR1, CR2, etc. In response to microbial infection complement activation results in flagging microorganisms with opsonins for facilitated phagocytosis, formation of MAC on cells such as Gram-negative bacteria leading to cell lysis, and release of C3a and C5a to stimulate downstream immune responses and to attract leukocytes. Most pathogens can be eliminated by these complement-mediated host responses, though some pathogenic microorganisms have developed ways of avoiding complement recognition or blocking host complement attack resulting in greater virulence (Lambris JD et al. 2008; Serruto D et al. 2010). All three complement pathways (classical, lectin and alternative) have been implicated in clearance of dying cells (Mevorach D et al. 1998; Ogden CA et al. 2001; Gullstrand B et al.2009; Kemper C et al. 2008). Altered surfaces of apoptotic cells are recognized by complement proteins leading to opsonization and subsequent phagocytosis. In contrast to pathogens, apoptotic cells are believed to induce only a limited complement activation by allowing opsonization of altered surfaces but restricting the terminal pathway of MAC formation (Gershov D et al. 2000; Braunschweig A and Jozsi M 2011). Thus, opsonization facilitates clearance of dying cells and cell debris without triggering danger signals and further inflammatory responses (Fraser DA et al. 2007, 2009; Benoit ME et al. 2012). C1q-mediated complement activation by apoptotic cells has been shown in a variety of human cells: keratinocytes, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), Jurkat T lymphoblastoid cells, lung adenocarcinoma cells (Korb LC and Ahearn JM 1997; Mold C and Morris CA 2001; Navratil JS et al. 2001; Nauta AJ et al. 2004). In addition to C1q the opsonization of apoptotic Jurkat T cells with MBL also facilitated clearance of these cells by both dendritic cells (DC) and macrophages (Nauta AJ et al. 2004). Also C3b, iC3b and C4b deposition on apoptotic cells as a consequence of activation of the complement cascade may promote complement-mediated phagocytosis. C1q, MBL and cleavage fragments of C3/C4 can bind to several receptors expressed on macrophages (e.g. cC1qR (calreticulin), CR1, CR3, CR4) suggesting a potential clearance mechanism through this interaction (Mevorach D et al. 1998; Ogden CA et al. 2001). Apoptosis is also associated with an altered expression of complement regulators on the surface of apoptotic cells. CD46 (MCP) bound to the plasma membrane of a healthy cell protects it from complement-mediated attack by preventing deposition of C3b and C4b, and reduced expression of CD46 on dying cells may lead to enhanced opsonization (Elward K et al. 2005). Upregulation of CD55 (DAF) and CD59 on apoptotic cell surfaces may protect damaged cells against complement mediated lysis (Pedersen ED et al. 2007; Iborra A et al. 2003; Hensel F et al. 2001). In addition, fluid-phase complement regulators such as C4BP, CFH may also inhibit lysis of apoptotic cells by limiting complement activation (Trouw LA et al 2007; Braunschweig A and Jozsi M. 2011). Complement facilitates the clearance of immune complexes (IC) from the circulation (Chevalier J and Kazatchkine MD 1989; Nielsen CH et al. 1997). Erythrocytes bear clusters of complement receptor 1 (CR1 or CD35), which serves as an immune adherence receptor for C3 and/or C4 fragments deposited on IC that are shuttled to liver and spleen, where IC are transferred and processed by tissue macrophages through an Fc receptor-mediated process. Complement proteins are always present in the blood and a small percentage spontaneously activate. Inappropriate activation leads to host cell damage, so on healthy human cells any complement activation or amplification is strictly regulated by surface-bound regulators that accelerate decay of the convertases (CR1, CD55), act as a cofactor for the factor I (CFI)-mediated degradation of C3b and C4b (CR1, CD46), or prevent the formation of MAC (CD59). Soluble regulators such as C4BP, CFH and FHL1 recognize self surface pattern-like glycosaminoglycans and further impair activation. Complement components interact with other biological systems. Upon microbial infection complement acts in cooperation with Toll-like receptors (TLRs) to amplify innate host defense. Anaphylatoxin C5a binds C5a receptor (C5aR) resulting in a synergistic enhancement of the TLR and C5aR-mediated proinflammatory cytokine response to infection. This interplay is negatively modulated by co-ligation of TLR and the second C5a receptor, C5L2, suggesting the existence of complex immunomodulatory interactions (Kohl J 2006; Hajishengallis G and Lambris JD 2010). In addition to C5aR and C5L2, complement receptor 3 (CR3) facilitates TLR2 or TLR4 signaling pathways by promoting a recruitment of their sorting adaptor TIRAP (MAL) to the receptor complex (van Bruggen R et al. 2007; Kagan JC and Medzhitov R 2006). Complement may activate platelets or facilitate biochemical and morphological changes in the endothelium potentiating coagulation and contributing to homeostasis in response to injury (Oikonomopoulou K et al. 2012). The interplay of complement and coagulation also involves cleavage of C3 and C5 convertases by coagulation proteases, generating biologically active anaphylatoxins (Amara U et al. 2010). Complement is believed to link the innate response to both humoral and cell-mediated immunity (Toapanta FR and Ross TM 2006; Mongini PK et al. 1997). The majority of published data is based on experiments using mouse as a model organism. Further characterization of the influence of complement on B or T cell activation is required for the human system, since differences between murine models and the human system are not yet fully determined. Complement is also involved in regulation of mobilization and homing of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) from bone marrow to the circulation and peripheral tissue in order to accommodate blood cell replenishment (Reca R et al. 2006). Thus, the complement system orchestrates the host defense by sensing a danger signal and transmitting it into specific cellular responses while extensively communicating with associated biological pathways ranging from immunity and inflammation to homeostasis and development. Originally the larger fragment of Complement Factor 2 (C2) was designated C2a. However, complement scientists decided that the smaller of all C fragments should be designated with an 'a', the larger with a 'b', changing the nomenclature for C2. Recent literature may use the updated nomenclature and refer to the larger C2 fragment as C2b, and refer to the classical C3 convertase as C4bC2b. Throughout this pathway Reactome adheres to the original convention to agree with the current (Sep 2013) Uniprot names for C2 fragments. The complement cascade pathway is organised into the following sections: initial triggering, activation of C3 and C5, terminal pathway and regulation.\n View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=166658 Reactome].", "Pathway Ontology": "signaling pathway in the innate immune response", "Summary": "The complement cascade is a rapid and effective defense mechanism that senses danger or damage and triggers a response to eliminate foreign intruders, cellular debris, and altered host cells. Complement proteins circulate in the bloodstream in inactive states, but when triggered, they generate enzymatically active molecules and biological effectors, including opsonins, anaphylatoxins, and the lytic membrane attack complex (MAC). The complement cascade has three branches: the classical, lectin, and alternative pathways, which converge at the proteolytic cleavage of component C3. Activation of the complement system leads to several important outcomes, including opsonization of target cells, lysis of target cells via MAC assembly, production of anaphylatoxins involved in the host inflammatory response, and clearance of antibody-antigen complexes. The complement system is tightly regulated by a combination of initiation events and regulatory mechanisms, including soluble and membrane-bound regulators, to prevent damage to healthy host cells.

The major role of IL-1 type cytokines is to control pro-inflammatory reactions in response to tissue injury - either due to pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) or Danger associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). Interleukin-1 (IL-1), which includes IL-1\u00ce\u00b1 and IL-1\u00ce\u00b2, plays a crucial role in many auto inflammatory diseases. IL- 1\u00ce\u00b1 and IL-1\u00ce\u00b2 are produced predominantly by macrophages and monocytes, and to a lesser extent by other cell types such as epithelial cells endothelial cells and fibroblasts. IL-1 alpha, is a membrane anchored protein which signals through autocrine or juxtracrine mechanisms where as the soluble IL-1\u00ce\u00b2 acts in a paracrine or systemic manner. Significant progress has been achieved in the study of the signaling events mediated by IL-1 and the processes they control. Involvement of IL-1\u00ce\u00b1 or IL-1\u00ce\u00b2 in host responses to infections caused by intracellular microorganisms such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis as well as in autoinflammatory diseases makes its signaling components important candidates for drug targetting for these diseases. The two forms of IL-1 (IL-1\u00ce\u00b1 and IL-1\u00ce\u00b2) bind to the same cellular receptor, the Type I IL- 1 receptor (IL-1RI) to induce signaling. Upon receptor engagement, IL-1R1 forms a heterodimer with IL-1 receptor accessory protein (IL-1RAcP), which functions as a co receptor. IL-1RAcP cannot bind directly to IL-1 but is essential for IL-1-mediated signaling. Binding of IL-1 to this receptor complex leads to the activation of the transcription factor NF-\u00ce\u00baB through different signaling mechanisms. Two IL-1 receptor-associated kinases, IRAK-1 and IRAK-2 have been implicated in the activation of NF-\u00ce\u00baB. IRAK 1 and 2 functions as adapter proteins and protein kinases to transmit downstream signals. It recruits TRAF6 to the IL-1 receptor complex via an interaction with IL-1RAcP. Oligomerization of TRAF6 and subsequent formation of TAK1 and MEKK3 signaling complexes relays the signal via NF-\u00ce\u00baB-inducing kinase (NIK) to two I-kappaB kinases (IKK-1 and -2), leading to NF-kappaB activation. Activation of other mitogen activated protein kinases, including JNKs and p38 MAPK through various MAP2Ks also play important roles in mediating IL-1 responses by activating transcription through the AP-1 transcription factor. The above mentioned signaling events co-operatively induce the expression of IL-1 target genes such as CCL2, IL-8 and IL-6. The interactions and intersections between canonical and non-canonical Interleukin-1 signaling systems are depicted in the pathway map. Regulation of IL-1 signaling can be brought about by various mechanisms. The IL-1 family member IL-1RA can bind to the IL1-R1 receptor with similar affinity as IL-1\u00ce\u00b1 and \u00ce\u00b2, but is incapable of activating the signaling response. The type II IL-1 receptor can bind to IL-1 alpha and beta but lacks signaling capacity. The naturally occurring 'shed' domains of the extracellular IL-1 receptor chains (IL-1RI, IL-1RII and IL- 1RAcP) also act as inhibitors of IL-1 signaling. In the cell, IL-1R binds to toll- interacting protein (TOLLIP), which results in the inhibition of IRAK1 and by promoting efficient degradation of IL-1R by targeting the internalized receptor to endosomes. Other mechanisms such as p38MAPK mediated phosphorylation of TAB1 which results in the inactivation of TAK1, and expression of genes including MAPK phosphatase 1 (MKP-1) and Inhibitor of kappa B alpha (NFKBIA) that inhibit IL-1 signaling components also serve as negative regulators of IL-1 signaling.\n\nPlease access this pathway at [http://www.netpath.org/netslim/IL_1_pathway.html NetSlim] database.\n\nIf you use this pathway, please cite following paper:\nKandasamy, K., Mohan, S.

EF are composed of a central cross-linked core of elastin, surrounded by a mesh of microfibrils, which are composed largely of fibrillin. In addition to elastin and fibrillin-1, over 30 ancillary proteins are involved in mediating important roles in elastic fibre assembly as well as interactions with the surrounding environment. These include fibulins, elastin microfibril interface located proteins (EMILINs), microfibril-associated glycoproteins (MAGPs) and Latent TGF-beta binding proteins (LTBPs). Fibulin-5 for example, is expressed by vascular smooth muscle cells and plays an essential role in the formation of elastic fibres through mediating interactions between elastin and fibrillin (Yanigasawa et al. 2002, Freeman et al. 2005). In addition, it plays a role in cell adhesion through integrin receptors and has been shown to influence smooth muscle cell proliferation (Yanigasawa et al. 2002, Nakamura et al. 2002). EMILINs are a family of homologous glycoproteins originally identified in extracts of aortas. Found at the elastin-fibrillin interface, early studies showed that antibodies to EMILIN can affect the process of elastic fibre formation (Bressan et al. 1993). EMILIN1 has been shown to bind elastin and fibulin-5 and appears to coordinate their common interaction (Zanetti et al. 2004). MAGPs are found to co-localize with microfibrils. MAGP-1, for example, binds strongly to an N-terminal sequence of fibrillin-1. Other proteins found associated with microfibrils include vitronectin (Dahlback et al. 1990).<br><br>Fibrillin is most familiar as a component of elastic fibres but microfibrils with no elastin are found in the ciliary zonules of the eye and invertebrate circulatory systems. The addition of elastin to microfibrils is a vertebrate adaptation to high pulsatile pressures in their closed circulatory systems (Faury et al. 2003). Elastin appears to have emerged after the divergence of jawless vertebrates from other vertebrates (Sage 1982). <br><br>Fibrillin-1 is the major structural component of microfibrils. Fibrillin-2 is expressed earlier in development than fibrillin-1 and may be important for elastic fiber formation (Zhang et al. 1994). Fibrillin-3 arose as a duplication of fibrillin-2 that did not occur in the rodent lineage. It was first isolated from human brain (Corson et al. 2004).<br><br>Fibrillin assembly is not as well defined as elastin assembly. The primary structure of fibrillin is dominated by calcium binding epidermal growth factor like repeats (Kielty et al. 2002). Fibrillin may form dimers or trimers before secretion. However, multimerisation predominantly occurs outside the cell. Formation of fibrils appears to require cell surface structures suggesting an involvement of cell surface receptors. Fibrillin is assembled pericellularly (i.e. on or close to the cell surface) into microfibrillar arrays that undergo time dependent maturation into microfibrils with beaded-string appearance. Transglutaminase forms gamma glutamyl epsilon lysine isopeptide bonds within or between peptide chains. Additionally, intermolecular disulfide bond formation between fibrillins is an important contributor to fibril maturation (Reinhardt et al. 2000).<br><br>Models of fibrillin-1 microfibril structure suggest that the N-terminal half of fibrillin-1 is asymmetrically exposed in outer filaments, while the C-terminal half is buried in the interior (Kuo et al. 2007). Fibrillinopathies include Marfan syndrome, familial ectopia lentis, familial thoracic aneurysm, all due to mutations in the fibrillin-1 gene FBN1,  and congenital contractural arachnodactyly which is caused by mutation of FBN2 (Maslen & Glanville 1993, Davis & Summers 2012).<br><br>In vivo assembly of fibrillin requires the presence of extracellular fibronectin fibres (Sabatier et al. 2009). Fibrillins have Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) sequences that interact with integrins (Pfaff et al. 1996, Sakamoto et al. 1996, Bax et al., 2003, Jovanovic et al. 2008) and heparin-binding domains that interact with a cell-surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan (Tiedemann et al. 2001) possibly a syndecan (Ritty et al. 2003). Fibrillins also have a major role in binding and sequestering growth factors such as TGF beta into the ECM  (Neptune et al. 2003). Proteoglycans such as versican (Isogai et al. 2002), biglycan, and decorin (Reinboth et al. 2002) can interact with the microfibrils. They confer specific properties including hydration, impact absorption, molecular sieving, regulation of cellular activities, mediation of growth factor association, and release and transport within the extracellular matrix (Buczek-Thomas et al. 2002). In addition, glycosaminoglycans have been shown to interact with tropoelastin through its lysine side chains (Wu et al. 1999), regulating tropoelastin assembly (Tu & Weiss 2008).<br><br>Elastin is synthesized as a 70kDa monomer called tropoelastin, a highly hydrophobic protein composed largely of two types of domains that alternate along the polypeptide chain. Hydrophobic domains are rich in glycine, proline, alanine, leucine and valine. These amino acids occur in characteristic short (3-9 amino acids) tandem repeats, with a flexible and highly dynamic structure (Floquet et al. 2004). Unlike collagen, glycine in elastin is not rigorously positioned every 3 residues. However, glycine is distributed frequently throughout all hydrophobic domains of elastin, and displays a strong preference for inter-glycine spacing of 0-3 residues (Rauscher et al. 2006). <br><br>Elastic fibre formation involves the deposition of tropoelastin onto a template of fibrillin rich microfibrils. Recent results suggest that the first step of elastic fiber formation is the organization of small globules of elastin on the cell surface followed by globule aggregation into microfibres (Kozel et al. 2006). An important contribution to the initial stages assembly is thought to be made by the intrinsic ability of the protein to direct its own polymeric organization in a process termed 'coacervation' (Bressan et al. 1986). This self-assembly process appears to be determined by interactions between hydrophobic domains (Bressan et al. 1986, Vrhovski et al. 1997,  Bellingham et al. 2003, Cirulis & Keeley 2010) which result in alignment of the cross-linking domains, allowing the stabilization of elastin through the formation of cross-links generated through the oxidative deamination of lysine residues, catalyzed by members of the lysyl oxidase (LOX) family (Reiser et al. 1992, Mithieux & Weiss 2005). The first step in the cross-linking reaction is the oxidative formation of the delta aldehyde, known as alpha aminoadipic semialdehyde or allysine (Partridge 1963). Subsequent reactions that are probably spontaneous lead to the formation of cross-links through dehydrolysinonorleucine and allysine aldol, a trifunctional cross-link dehydromerodesmosine and two tetrafunctional cross-links desmosine and isodesmosine (Lucero & Kagan 2006), which are unique to elastin. These cross-links confer mechanical integrity and high durability. In addition to their role in self-assembly, hydrophobic domains provide elastin with its elastomeric properties, with initial studies suggesting that the elastomeric propereties of elastin are driven through changes in entropic interactions with surrounding water molecules (Hoeve & Flory 1974). <br><br>A very specific set of proteases, broadly grouped under the name elastases, is responsible for elastin remodelling (Antonicelli et al. 2007). The matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are particularly important in elastin breakdown, with MMP2, 3, 9 and 12 explicitly shown to degrade elastin (Ra & Parks 2007). Nonetheless, elastin typically displays a low turnover rate under normal conditions over a lifetime (Davis 1993).\n View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=1566948 Reactome].", "Summary": "Elastic fibre formation is a complex process that involves the assembly of elastin and microfibrils to provide essential properties of elastic recoil and resilience in dynamic connective tissues.

Once bound to ERBB4, SHC1 becomes phosphorylated on tyrosine residues by the tyrosine kinase activity of ERBB4, which enables it to recruit the complex of GRB2 and SOS1, resulting in the guanyl-nucleotide exchange on RAS and activation of RAF and MAP kinase cascade (Kainulainen et al. 2000). <br><br>The CYT1 isoforms of ERBB4 also possess a C-tail tyrosine residue that, upon trans-autophosphorylation, serves as a docking site for the p85 alpha subunit of PI3K (Kaushansky et al. 2008, Cohen et al. 1996), leading to assembly of an active PI3K complex that converts PIP2 to PIP3 and activates AKT signaling (Kainulainen et al. 2000). <br><br>Besides signaling as a conventional transmembrane receptor kinase, ERBB4 differs from other ERBBs in that JM-A isoforms signal through efficient release of a soluble intracellular domain. Ligand activated homodimers of ERBB4 JM-A isoforms (ERBB4 JM-A CYT1 and ERBB4 JM-A CYT2) undergo proteolytic cleavage by ADAM17 (TACE) in the juxtamembrane region, resulting in shedding of the extracellular domain and formation of an 80 kDa membrane bound ERBB4 fragment known as ERBB4 m80 (Rio et al. 2000, Cheng et al. 2003). ERBB4 m80 undergoes further proteolytic cleavage, mediated by the gamma-secretase complex, which releases the soluble 80 kDa ERBB4 intracellular domain, known as ERBB4 s80 or E4ICD, into the cytosol (Ni et al. 2001). ERBB4 s80 is able to translocate to the nucleus, promote nuclear translocation of various transcription factors, and act as a transcription co-factor. For example, in mammary cells, ERBB4 binds SH2 transcription factor STAT5A. ERBB4 s80 shuttles STAT5A to the nucleus, and actsa as a STAT5A co-factor in binding to and promoting transcription from the beta-casein (CSN2) promoter, and may be involved in the regulation of other lactation-related genes (Jones et al. 1999, Williams et al. 2004, Muraoka-Cook et al. 2008). ERBB4 s80 binds activated estrogen receptor in the nucleus and acts as a transcriptional co-factor in promoting transcription of some estrogen-regulated genes, including progesterone receptor gene NR3C3 and CXCL12 (SDF1) (Zhu et al. 2006). In neuronal precursors, ERBB4 s80 binds the complex of TAB and NCOR1, helps to move the complex into the nucleus, and is a co-factor of TAB:NCOR1-mediated inhibition of expression of astrocyte differentiation genes GFAP and S100B (Sardi et al. 2006).<br><br>The C-tail of ERBB4 possesses several WW-domain binding motifs (three in CYT1 isoform and two in CYT2 isoform), which enable interaction of ERBB4 with WW-domain containing proteins. ERBB4 s80, through WW-domain binding motifs, interacts with YAP1 transcription factor, a known proto-oncogene, and is a co-regulator of YAP1-mediated transcription in association with TEAD transcription factors (Komuro et al. 2003, Omerovic et al. 2004). Hence, the WW binding motif couples ERBB4 to the major effector arm of the HIPPO signaling pathway. The tumor suppressor WWOX, another WW-domain containing protein, competes with YAP1 in binding to ERBB4 s80 and prevents translocation of ERBB4 s80 to the nucleus (Aqeilan et al. 2005).<br><br>WW-domain binding motifs in the C-tail of ERBB4 play an important role in the downregulation of ERBB4 receptor signaling, enabling the interaction of intact ERBB4, ERBB4 m80 and ERBB4 s80 with NEDD4 family of E3 ubiquitin ligases WWP1 and ITCH. The interaction of WWP1 and ITCH with intact ERBB4 is independent of receptor activation and autophosphorylation. Binding of WWP1 and ITCH ubiquitin ligases leads to ubiquitination of ERBB4 and its cleavage products, and subsequent degradation through both proteasomal and lysosomal routes (Omerovic et al. 2007, Feng et al. 2009). In addition, the s80 cleavage product of ERBB4 JM-A CYT-1 isoform is the target of NEDD4 ubiquitin ligase. NEDD4 binds ERBB4 JM-A CYT-1 s80 (ERBB4jmAcyt1s80) through its PIK3R1 interaction site and mediates ERBB4jmAcyt1s80 ubiquitination, thereby decreasing the amount of ERBB4jmAcyt1s80 that reaches the nucleus (Zeng et al. 2009).<br><br>ERBB4 also binds the E3 ubiquitin ligase MDM2, and inhibitor of p53 (Arasada et al. 2005). Other proteins that bind to ERBB4 intracellular domain have been identified by co-immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry (Gilmore-Hebert et al., 2010), and include transcriptional co-repressor TRIM28/KAP1, which promotes chromatin compaction. DNA damage signaling through ATM releases TRIM28-associated heterochromatinization. Interactions of ERBB4 with TRIM28 and MDM2 may be important for integration of growth factor responses and DNA damage responses.<br><br>In human breast cancer cell lines, ERBB4 activation enhances anchorage-independent colony formation in soft agar but inhibits cell growth in a monolayer culture. Different ERBB4 ligands induce different gene expression changes in breast cancer cell lines. Some of the genes induced in response to ERBB4 signaling in breast cancer cell lines are RAB2, EPS15R and GATA4. It is not known if these gene are direct transcriptional targets of ERBB4 (Amin et al. 2004).<br><br>Transcriptome and ChIP-seq comparisons of full-length and intracellular domain isoforms in isogenic MCF10A mammary cell background have revealed the diversification of ERBB4 signaling engendered by alternative splicing and cleavage (Wali et al., 2014). ERBB4 broadly affected protease expression, cholesterol biosynthesis, HIF1-alpha signaling, and HIPPO signaling pathways, and other pathways were differentially activated by CYT1 and CYT2 isoforms. For example, CYT1 promoted expression of transcription factors TWIST1 and SNAIL1 that promote epithelial-mesenchymal transition. HIF1-alpha and HIPPO signaling are mediated, respectively, by binding of ERBB4 to HIF1-alpha and to YAP (Paatero et al., 2012, Komuro et al., 2003). ERBB4 increases activity of the transcription factor SREBF2, resulting in increased expression of SREBF2-target genes involved in cholesterol biosynthesis. The mechanism is not known and may involve facilitation of SREBF2 cleavage through ERBB4-mediated PI3K signaling (Haskins et al. 2016).<br><br>In some contexts, ERBB4 promotes growth suppression or apoptosis (Penington et al., 2002). Activation of ERBB4 in breast cancer cell lines leads to JNK dependent increase in BRCA1 mRNA level and mitotic cell cycle delay, but the exact mechanism has not been elucidated (Muraoka Cook et al. 2006). The nature of growth responses may be connected with the spliced isoforms expressed. In comparisons of CYT1 vs CYT2 (full-length and ICD) expression in mammary cells, CYT1 was a weaker growth inducer, associated with attenuated MAPK signaling relative to CYT2 (Wali et al., 2014). ERBB4 s80 is also able to translocate to the mitochondrial matrix, presumably when its nuclear translocation is inhibited. Once in the mitochondrion, the BH3 domain of ERBB4, characteristic of BCL2 family members, may enable it to act as a pro apoptotic factor (Naresh et al. 2006).<br><br>ERBB4 plays important roles in the developing and adult nervous system. Erbb4 deficiency in somatostatin-expressing neurons of the thalamic reticular nucleus alters behaviors dependent on sensory selection (Ahrens et al. 2015). NRG1-activated ERBB4 signaling enhances AMPA receptor responses through PKC-dependent AMPA receptor exocytosis. This results in an increased excitatory input to parvalbumin-expressing inhibitory neurons in the visual cortex and regulates visual cortical plasticity (Sun et al. 2016). NRG1-activated ERBB4 signaling is involved in GABAergic activity in amygdala which mediates fear conditioning (fear memory) (Lu et al. 2014). Conditional Erbb4 deletion from fast-spiking interneurons, chandelier and basket cells of the cerebral cortex leads to synaptic defects associated with increased locomotor activity and abnormal emotional, social and cognitive function that can be linked to some of the schizophrenia features. The level of GAD1 (GAD67) protein is reduced in the cortex of conditional Erbb4 mutants. GAD1 is a GABA synthesizing enzyme. Cortical mRNA levels of GAD67 are consistently decreased in schizophrenia (Del Pino et al. 2014). Erbb4 is expressed in the GABAergic neurons of the bed nucleus stria terminalis, a part of the extended amygdala. Inhibition of NRG1-triggered ERBB4 signaling induces anxiety-like behavior, which depends on GABAergic neurotransmission. NRG1-ERBB4 signaling stimulates presynaptic GABA release, but the exact mechanism is not known (Geng et al. 2016). NRG1 protects cortical interneurons against ischemic brain injury through ERBB4-mediated increase in GABAergic transmission (Guan et al. 2015). NRG2-activated ERBB4 can reduce the duration of GABAergic transmission by binding to GABA receptors at the postsynaptic membrane via their GABRA1 subunit and promoting endocytosis of GABA receptors (Mitchell et al. 2013). NRG1 promotes synchronization of prefrontal cortex interneurons in an ERBB4 dependent manner (Hou et al. 2014). NRG1-ERBB4 signaling protects neurons from the cell death induced by a mutant form of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) (Woo et al. 2012).<br><br>Clinical relevance of ERBB4 has been identified in several contexts. In cancer, putative and validated gain-of-function mutations or gene amplification that may be drivers have been identified at modest frequencies, and may also contribute to resistance to EGFR and ERBB2-targeted therapies. This is noteworthy as ERBB4 kinase activity is inhibited by pan-ERBB tyrosine kinase inhibitors, including lapatinib, which is approved by the US FDA. The reduced prevalence relative to EGFR and ERBB2 in cancer may reflect more restricted expression of ERBB4, or differential signaling, as specific ERBB4 isoforms have been linked to growth inhibition or apoptosis in experimental systems. ERBB2/ERBB4 heterodimers protect cardiomyocytes, so reduced activity of ERBB4 in patients treated with the ERBB2-targeted therapeutic antibody trastuzumab may contribute to the cardiotoxicity of this agent when used in combination with (cardiotoxic) anthracyclines.<br><br>With the importance of ERBB4 in developing and adult nervous system, NRG1 and/or ERBB4 polymorphisms, splicing aberrations and mutations have been linked to nervous system disorders including schizophrenia and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, although these findings are not yet definitive.\n View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=1236394 Reactome].", "Pathway Ontology": "signaling pathway", "Summary": "ERBB4, a member of the ERBB family of receptors, plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including growth, differentiation, and survival.

The multiple biological activities of TWEAK include stimulation of cell growth and angiogenesis, induction of inflammatory cytokines, and stimulation of apoptosis. It has been shown to be involved in the induction of cellular proliferation in liver cells, osteoblasts, astrocytes, synoviocytes, kidney cells and skeletal muscles. Furthermore, TWEAK plays a substantial role in cellular differentiation in osteoclasts. TWEAK induces glioma cell survival via imparting resistance to cytotoxic agents. It imparts its downstream signaling events by binding to its receptor, FGF inducible 14 protein (Fn14). Two modes of TWEAK-Fn14 (ligand-receptor) interactions have been proposed (i) the ligand dependent interaction which involves the higher concentration of homotrimeric TWEAK, that binds to low concentration of Fn14 in a heterohexameric complex (ii) ligand-independent interaction when the ligand concentration is lower than the receptor concentration which induces the ligand independent interaction. The receptors homotrimerize to activate the downstream events. The signaling cascades reported under TWEAK-Fn14 interactions are the canonical and noncanonical NF-\u03baB pathways and the MAPK pathway. There has been a report on crosstalk between Wnt and TWEAK pathways. In myoblasts the PI3K-AKT module has been reported to be inhibited under TWEAK stimulus.

To stimulate RET, these ligands need a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored co-receptor, collectively termed GDNF family receptor-alpha (GFRA) (Treanor et al. 1996, Jing et al. 1996). The four members of this family have different, overlapping ligand preferences. GFRA1, GFRA2, GFRA3, and GFRA4 preferentially bind GDNF, NRTN, ARTN and PSPN, respectively (Jing et al. 1996, 1997, Creedon et al. 1997, Baloh et al. 1997, 1998, Masure et al. 2000). The GFRA co-receptor can come from the same cell as RET, or from a different cell. When the co-receptor is produced by the same cell as RET, it is termed cis signaling. When the co-receptor is produced by another cell, it is termed trans signaling. Cis and trans activation has been proposed to diversify RET signaling, either by recruiting different downstream effectors or by changing the kinetics or efficacy of kinase activation (Tansey et al. 2000, Paratcha et al. 2001). Whether cis and trans signaling has significant differences in vivo is unresolved (Fleming et al. 2015). Different GDNF family members could activate similar downstream signaling pathways since all GFRAs bind to and activate the same tyrosine kinase and induce coordinated phosphorylation of the same four RET tyrosines (Tyr905, Tyr1015, Tyr1062, and Tyr1096) with similar kinetics (Coulpier et al. 2002).

RET is a receptor tyrosine kinase that, upon binding to its ligands, such as glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and its family members, undergoes autophosphorylation and activates downstream signaling pathways. The RET receptor interacts with glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored co-receptors, known as GDNF family receptor-alpha (GFRA), which are essential for ligand binding and signal transduction. The RET signaling pathway plays a significant role in the development and maintenance of the nervous system, and its dysregulation has been implicated in various diseases, including papillary thyroid carcinoma, multiple endocrine neoplasia, and Hirschsprung's disease.

Intermolecular ligation of one PAR molecule by another can occur but is less efficient than self-ligation. A synthetic peptide of sequence SFLLRN, the first six amino acids of the new N-terminus generated when thrombin cleaves PAR1, can activate PAR1 independent of protease and receptor cleavage. PARs are key to platelet activation. Four PARs have been identified, of which PARs 1 ,3 and 4 are substrates for thrombin. In humans PAR 1 is the predominant thrombin receptor followed by PAR4 which is less responsive to thrombin. PAR 3 is not considered important for human platelet responses as it is minimally expressed, though this is not the case for mouse. PAR2 is not expressed in platelets. In mouse platelets, Gq is necessary for platelet secretion and aggregation in response to thrombin but is not necessary for thrombin-triggered shape change.

NOTCH2 but not NOTCH1 coactivator complexes, stimulate FCER2 transcription. Overexpression of FCER2 (CD23A) is a hallmark of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) and correlates with the malfunction of apoptosis, which is thought be an underlying mechanism of B-CLL development (Hubmann et al. 2002).

Evidence shows that ceramide metabolism is deregulated in cellular senescence and can even induce it. (Venable et al., 2006).\n\nCeramides are thought to induce senescence in a p53 dependent and independent manner by hypophosphorylated retinoblastoma protein (Lee et al., 2000; Dix 2018; Jeffries & Krupenko, 2018). Ceramides function both down- and upstream of p53 (Jeffries et al., 2018). p53 mediates the interference of the phosphorylation of retinoblastoma-like protein RBL1 and RBL through the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 (Jeffries et & Krupenko, 2018). Additionally, p53 has been demonstrated to directly activate ceramide synthase. (Jeffries & Krupenko, 2018). Consequently, this implies a feedback mechanism between ceramides and the tumor suppressor.  Ceramide also interacts directly with human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) by inhibiting it, therefore causing telomere instability (Hannun & Obeid, 2002; Deevska et al., 2021). \n\nCeramides activate protein phosphatase 1 and 2A (PP1 and PP2A), which increases the levels of p21 (Trayssac et al., 2018). This then inhibits the cyclin dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) and CDK4. As a consequence, the retinoblastoma protein is hypophosphorylated and induces senescence (Lee et al., 2000; Dix 2018). The hypophosphorylated retinoblastoma protein leads to the inhibition of E2F (Dix, 2018; Jeffries & Krupenko, 2018). This group of genes is normally responsible for cell proliferation and therefore their inhibition causes senescence (Dix 2018). In addition to that, PP1 and PP2A directly interfere with Rb by dephosphorylating it (Dix 2018). These two phosphatases also inhibit the mTOR pathway that is associated with cell proliferation (Millner & Atilla-Gokcumen, 2020).\n\nSphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is thought to induce cell proliferation and migration by binding to S1PR1 and S1PR5. This is downregulated in senescence (Trayssac et al., 2018). In cellular senescence, S1P has been shown to be depleted as a result of a downregulation of sphingosine kinase 1 (SPHK1), induced by p53. The downregulation of SK1 is thought to be due to its degradation induced by p53 (Kim et al., 2019). Moreover, S1P has hTERT as a direct target and promotes its stability (Magali et al., 2021). Furthermore, there is an increase in S1P binding to the S1P receptor 2 (S1PR2), which has been associated with the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and therefore the SASP. S1P is also thought to inhibit ceramide synthase 2 (CERS2), which catalyzes the conversion of sphingosine into ceramide (Magali et al., 2021). \n\nSphingosine is increased in senescence cells by the increase of S1P-phopshatase (SGPP1) and the increase in acid ceramidase ASAH-1 SGPP1 catalyzes the conversion of S1P to sphingosine, while ASAH-1 catalyzes the conversion of ceramide to sphingosine (Munk et al., 2021; Kim et al., 2019). This causes the dephosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein, which further causes senescence (Trayssac et al., 2018).\n\nCeramide can be synthesized de novo starting with the conversion of palmitoyl-CoA and serine to 3-ketodihydrosphingosine. Upregulation of ceramide synthase 4 (CERS4), which converts dihydro-sphingosine into dihydro-ceramide. CERS4 has been thought to be a key enzyme in two types of senescence: OIS and replicative senescence, by mediating its effects through the PP1-Rb-E2F axis (Dix, 2018)\n\nGalactosidase \u03b21 (GLB1) and in glucosylceramidase (GBA), which catalyze the conversion of lactosylceramide to glucosylceramide and the conversion of glucosylceramide to ceramide, respectively, are upregulated in cellular senescence. Additionally, there is a decrease in glucosylceramidase synthase, which catalyzes the formation of glucosylceramide from ceramide (Flor et al., 2017).\n\nActivation of p53, due to DNA damage, leads to an increase of neutral sphingomyelinase 2 (nSMase 2) (Deevska et al., 2021; Jeffries & Krupenko, 2018). Moreover, it has been noted that in senescent cells, there are elevated levels of neutral sphingomyelinases ( Millner & Atilla-Gokcumen, 2020). These enzymes catalyze the conversion of sphingomyelin to ceramide (Gey & Seeger, 2013).\n\nElevated ceramide levels result in elevated diacylglycerol (DAG) levels (Deevska et al., 2021). These two lipids are linked by sphingomyelin synthase 2 (SGMS2). SGMS2 catalyzes the transfer of a phosphorycholine group from phosphatidylcholine to ceramide, yielding sphingomyelin and DAG.  In cellular senescence, SMS was found to be overexpressed. This caused an increase in DAG which caused the chronic activation of its downstream effectors. This causes the downregulation of protein kinase C \u03b1 and \u03b2 (PKC\u03b1 and \u03b2) via the prolonged activation of phospholipase C. The consequences of this is the activation of p53 and p38, leading to SASP and senescence (Deevska et al., 2021).", "Pathway Ontology": "aging pathway && sphingolipid metabolic pathway", "Summary": "Ceramide metabolism plays a crucial role in regulating cellular senescence.

In neural development, p75NTR is involved in the regulation of axon growth and guidance, and its dysregulation has been implicated in various neurological disorders. The role of p75NTR in cell migration and invasion highlights its potential as a therapeutic target for the treatment of cancer and other diseases characterized by aberrant cell migration and invasion.

This is hypothesized to match with the increased need for proteins and lipids needed for senescence-associated events such as extracellular secretions (SASP) and cell enlargement (Wiley & Campisi, 2016). It is also supposed to cause an increase in NF-\u03baB signalling and cause inflammatory cascades associated with senescence. Glycolysis is also responsible for increased lactate production by producing pyruvate, along with several other mechanisms including upregulated lactate dehydrogenase (LDHA), pyruvate kinase (PKM), serinolysis and glutaminolysis. Pyruvate kinase (PKM) is responsible for the last conversion step of glycolysis, producing pyruvate. The enzyme is upregulated in replicative senescence and leads to increased TCA activity and oxygen consumption rate (Sabbatinelli et al., 2019). Findings were similar in another study on oncogene-induced senescence (OIS) (D\u00f6rr et al., 2013). PKM is also thought to increase lactate production indirectly (Zwerschke et al., 2003). In parallel, lactate dehydrogenase (LDHA) is also upregulated, which leads to this increase in lactate levels in senescent cells. Senescence induced by oncogenes also has an impact on serinolysis and glutaminolysis. These are processes in which serine and glutamine are consumed to produce energy. They usually take place in tumour cells as an alternative source of energy, and produce lactate (among others) as a by-product. It has been found that both processes are increased in OIS, and lead to increases in lactate levels (Mazurek et al., 2001). Such increased levels of lactate lead to several events associated with senescence, such as tumorigenesis, wound healing and evasion from immune responses (Nacarelli & Sell, 2017). \n\nThe upregulation of several glycolytic enzymes seems to mediate increased glycolysis in various types of induced senescence. Depending on the stimulus, various proteins and genes influence glycolytic rates. For example, in irradiation-induced senescence, this effect seems to be mediated by AMPK activation and NF-kB signalling (Nacarelli & Sell, 2017). Similarly, in OIS, the retinoblastoma protein appears to upregulate glycolytic genes (Nacarelli & Sell, 2017). The very important p53 is known to be a central mediator of senescence, due to its role in cell cycle regulation. It has been found to negatively affect glycolysis (Gu et al., 2018). However it also has an indirect positive effect on it, by activating G6PDH in stressed cells (Jiang et al., 2011). TP53 is therefore thought to have a regulatory role on glycolysis and is interesting in the context of senescence.\n\nWhile most glycolytic enzymes are upregulated (Zwerschke et al., 2003), GAPDH seems to decrease.

The alpha6beta4 integrin is a component of Hemidesmosomes (HDs) (3, 4,5). Increased expression of alphaEbeta4 and changes in its distribution is found to be correlated with increased aggressiveness of tumors and poor prognosis (6, 7). Although integrin alpha6beta4, can interact with different laminin isoforms, its preferred ligand in the epidermal BM is laminin-5 (8, 9). The beta4 integrin is a large protein and has a cytoplasmic domain of more than 1000 amino acids (10, 11). This domain contains a Na-Ca exchanger (CalX) motif followed by two pairs of type III fibronectin (FNIII) domains separated by a connecting segment (CS). It is found to associate with the intermediate filament system through plectin and BP230, which are components of hemidesmosomes (12,13,14).

Apart from its effects on keratinocytes, evidence suggests that integrin alpha6beta4 is important in cancer cell invasion (21,22,23,24) and survival (25,26,27,28,16,29). The cancer cell invasion is regulated through a IRS/PI3K dependent process while the effect on carcinoma cell survival in a PI3K/Akt and dependent manner.

The influence of regucalcin on the intra-and extracellular Ca2+ regulation is showed which are both involved in cell proliferation, ion transport and apoptosis and are important in normal kidney function. When the regulation of regucalcin and other factors are downregulated and suppressed the kidney fails in functionality and so renal fibrosis will develop.\nFirst of all, TNF-B and TNF-a do have an impact on the activity of Smad which has an impact on the development of a-SMA that induced renal fibrosis. NF-kB, stimulated by TNF-a, activates the transcription factor p65 that induced the IL-8 expression which is involved in inflammatory pathways. On the other hand, regucalcin inhibits the a-SMA which means that the formation of renal fibrosis is inhibited. Further, TNF-B stimulates the caspase 8 that activates the cytochrome C which activate the apoptosis pathway. Also, here regucalcin function as an inhibitor for Apaf1 that results in an inhibition of the apoptosis pathway and activate the Bcl-2 (suppressor of apoptotic cell death). Besides the TNF-B and TNF-a pathway, there is an RTK pathway illustrated which activates the PI3K and RAS pathway for stimulation of the protein and cell proliferation. According to Yamaguchi M. (2015), regucalcin activates the Akt1 to induce the protein proliferation even further when PI3K is inhibited. The RTK pathway shows interaction with the cAMP pathway that stimulate the protein kinase A and the PIP2 pathway that stimulate the protein kinase C and IP3. These all will stimulate Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This Ca2+ can migrate and enters the mitochondria through the Ca2+ uniporter which results in the activation of mitochondrial biological processes or release of different mitochondrial factors. Hence, calcium controls and modulate cell apoptosis and inflammation. MAP3K pathway might be involved in the stimulation of RAF1 to induce the cell proliferation and the increase in apoptosis by inhibition of Bcl-2 through JNK which is also activated by ROS. Ca2+ released by the ER can also bind to calmodulin to form the Ca2+/calmodulin complex that stimulates IP3, JNK, NOS, RGPR\u2014p117 and NF1. The latter two proteins are involved in the enhancement of regucalcin gene expression. On the other hand, regucalcin can inhibit the activity of Ca2+/calmodulin complex and the NOS. Normally, phosphodiesterase binds cAMP that induced the degradation of cAMP which results in a decrease of protein kinase A that leads to a reduction of ER Ca2+ release. Regucalcin inhibits the phosphodiesterase in such a way that cAMP will not be degraded and the ER Ca2+ release can further occur. Remaining Ca2+ released from the ER can also transport to the microsomes, enters vis Ca2+ uniporter, to induce microsomal activities. This process of microsomal Ca2+ uptake can be diminished through the inhibition of IP3 kinase. Regucalcin is not only involved in the regulation of intracellular Ca2+ release or uptake, but also extracellular Ca2+ by stimulating the Ca2+/ATPase which leads to Ca2+ export. Besides that, the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger is important to be present on the basolateral membrane of the proximal tubule epithelial kidney cell to regulate the ion transport. On the apical membrane is the TRPV5 receptor present that regulate the import of Ca2+ from the lumen back into the kidney cell, but Ca2+ can also travel via paracellular transport. Further, in the nucleus the regucalcin has an influence on the inhibition of the serine/threonine phosphate (PSP), tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) and calcineurin gene expression. Normally, PSP stimulates the protein kinase A- and so the ER Ca2+ release-, PTP stimulates the cell growth and differentiation and calcineurin will migrate to the cytoplasm for binding to the Ca2+ and stimulates the formation of Ca2+/calmodulin complex.

However, deregulation of Cyclin Dependent Kinase-5 (CDK5) activity in these neurons can aberrantly activate various components of cell cycle leading to neuronal death (Chang et al. 2012). Random activation of cell cycle proteins has been shown to play a key role in the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative disorders (Yang et al. 2003, Lopes et al. 2009). CDK5 is not activated by the canonical cyclins, but binds to its own specific partners, CDK5R1 and CDK5R2 (aka p35 and p39, respectively) (Tsai et al. 1994, Tang et al. 1995). Expression of p35 is nearly ubiquitous, whereas p39 is largely expressed in the central nervous system. A variety of neurotoxic insults such as beta-amyloid (A-beta), ischemia, excitotoxicity and oxidative stress disrupt the intracellular calcium homeostasis in neurons, thereby leading to the activation of calpain, which cleaves p35 into p25 and p10 (Lee et al. 2000). p25 has a six-fold longer half-life compared to p35 and lacks the membrane anchoring signal, which results in its constitutive activation and mislocalization of the CDK5:p25 complex to the cytoplasm and the nucleus. There, CDK5:p25 is able to access and phosphorylate a variety of atypical targets, triggering a cascade of neurotoxic pathways that culminate in neuronal death. One such neurotoxic pathway involves CDK5-mediated random activation of cell cycle proteins which culminate in neuronal death. Exposure of primary cortical neurons to oligomeric beta-amyloid (1-42) hyper-activates CDK5 due to p25 formation, which in turn phosphorylates CDC25A, CDC25B and CDC25C.

Kadonaga, 2004, Maston, 2006, Barolo, 2002; Roeder, 2005, Rosenfeld, 2006).  Of the three major classes of DNA polymerase involved in eukaryotic gene transcription, Polymerase II generally regulates protein-encoding genes.   Figure 1 shows a diagram of the various components involved in cell-specific regulation of Pol-II gene transcription. <br><br>Core Promoter: Pol II-regulated genes typically have a Core Promoter where Pol II and a variety of general factors bind to specific DNA motifs: <br>   i: the TATA box (TATA DNA sequence), which is bound by the \"TATA-binding protein\" (TBP).<br>   ii: the Initiator motif (INR), where Pol II and certain other core factors bind, is present in many Pol II-regulated genes.<br>   iii: the Downstream Promoter Element (DPE), which is present in a subset of Pol II genes, and where additional core factors bind.  <br>The core promoter binding factors are generally ubiquitously expressed, although there are exceptions to this.<br><br>Proximal Promoter: immediately upstream (5') of the core promoter, Pol II target genes often have a Proximal Promoter region that spans up to 500 base pairs (b.p.), or even to 1000 b.p..  This region contains a number of functional DNA binding sites for a specific set of transcription activator (TA) and transcription repressor (TR) proteins.  These TA and TR factors are generally cell- or tissue-specific in expression, rather than ubiquitous, so that the presence of their cognate binding sites in the proximal promoter region programs cell- or tissue-specific expression of the target gene, perhaps in conjunction with TA and TR complexes bound in distal enhancer regions.  <br><br>Distal Enhancer(s): many or most Pol II regulated genes in higher eukaryotes have one or more distal Enhancer regions which are essential for proper regulation of the gene, often in a cell or tissue-specific pattern.  Like the proximal promoter region, each of the distal enhancer regions typically contain a cluster of binding sites for specific TA and/or TR DNA-binding factors, rather than just a single site. <br><br>   Enhancers generally have three defining characteristics:<br>     i: They can be located very long distances from the promoter of the target gene they regulate, sometimes as far as 100 Kb, or more.<br>     ii: They can be either upstream (5') or downstream (3') of the target gene, including within introns of that gene.<br>     iii: They can function in either orientation in the DNA.<br><br>Combinatorial mechanisms of transcription regulation: The specific combination of TA and TR binding sites within the proximal promoter and/or distal enhancer(s) provides a \"combinatorial transcription code\" that mediates cell- or tissue-specific expression of the associated target gene.  Each promoter or enhancer region mediates expression in a specific subset of the overall expression pattern.  In at least some cases, each enhancer region functions completely independently of the others, so that the overall expression pattern is a linear combination of the expression patterns of each of the enhancer modules.<br><br>Co-Activator and Co-Repressor Complexes:  DNA-bound TA and TR proteins typically recruit the assembly of specific Co-Activator (Co-A) and Co-Repressor (Co-R) Complexes, respectively, which are essential for regulating target gene transcription.  Both Co-A's and Co-R's  are multi-protein complexes that contain several specific protein components.<br><br>Co-Activator complexes generally contain at lease one component protein that has Histone Acetyl Transferase (HAT) enzymatic activity.  This functions to acetylate Histones and/or other chromatin-associated factors, which typically increases that transcription activation of the target gene.  By contrast, Co-Repressor complexes generally contain at lease one component protein that has Histone De-Acetylase (HDAC) enzymatic activity.  This functions to de-acetylate Histones and/or other chromatin-associated factors. This typically increases the transcription repression of the target gene.<br><br>Adaptor (Mediator) complexes: In addition to the co-activator complexes that assemble on particular cell-specific TA factors,  - there are at least two additional transcriptional co-activator complexes common to most cells.  One of these is the Mediator complex, which functions as an \"adaptor\" complex that bridges between the tissue-specific co-activator complexes assembled in the proximal promoter (or distal enhancers).  The human Mediator complex has been shown to contain at least 19 protein distinct components.  Different combinations of these co-activator proteins are also found to be components of specific transcription Co-Activator complexes, such as the DRIP, TRAP and ARC complexes described below.  <br><br>TBP/TAF complex: Another large Co-A complex is the \"TBP-associated factors\" (TAFs) that assemble on TBP (TATA-Binding Protein), which is bound to the TATA box present in many promoters.  There are at least 23 human TAF proteins that have been identified.  Many of these are ubiquitously expressed, but TAFs can also be expressed in a cell or tissue-specific pattern.  <br><br>\n\n\n<b>\tSpecific Coactivator Complexes for DNA-binding Transcription Factors.</b>   <br><br>A number of specific co-activator complexes for DNA-binding transcription factors have been identified, including DRIP, TRAP, and ARC (reviewed in Bourbon, 2004, Blazek, 2005, Conaway, 2005, and Malik, 2005).  The DRIP co-activator complex was originally identified and named as a specific complex associated with the Vitamin D Receptor member of the nuclear receptor family of transcription factors (Rachez, 1998).  Similarly, the TRAP co-activator complex was originally identified as a complex that associates with the thyroid receptor (Yuan, 1998).   It was later determined that all of the components of the DRIP complex are also present in the TRAP complex, and the ARC complex (discussed further below).  For example, the DRIP205 and TRAP220 proteins were show to be identical, as were specific pairs of the other components of these complexes (Rachez, 1999).<br><br>In addition, these various transcription co-activator proteins identified in mammalian cells were found to be the orthologues or homologues of the Mediator (\"adaptor\") complex proteins (reviewed in Bourbon, 2004).  The Mediator proteins were originally identified in yeast  by Kornberg and colleagues, as complexes associated with DNA polymerase (Kelleher, 1990).  In higher organisms, Adapter complexes bridge between the basal transcription factors (including Pol II) and tissue-specific transcription factors (TFs) bound to sites within upstream Proximal Promoter regions or distal Enhancer regions (Figure 1).  However, many of the Mediator homologues can also be found in complexes associated with specific transcription factors in higher organisms.  A unified nomenclature system for these adapter / co-activator proteins now labels them Mediator 1 through Mediator 31 (Bourbon, 2004).  For example, the DRIP205 / TRAP220 proteins are now identified as Mediator 1 (Rachez, 1999), based on homology with yeast Mediator 1.<br><br>\n\n\n\n<b>Example Pathway: Specific Regulation of Target Genes During Notch Signaling:</b> <br><br>One well-studied example of cell-specific regulation of gene transcription is selective regulation of target genes during Notch signaling.  Notch signaling was first identified in Drosophila, where it has been studied in detail at the genetic, molecular, biochemical and cellular levels (reviewed in Justice, 2002; Bray, 2006; Schweisguth, 2004; Louvri, 2006).  In Drosophila, Notch signaling to the nucleus is thought always to be mediated by one specific DNA binding transcription factor, Suppressor of Hairless.  In mammals, the homologous genes are called CBF1 (or RBPJkappa), while in worms they are called Lag-1, so that the acronym \"CSL\" has been given to this conserved transcription factor family.  There are at least two human CSL homologues, which are now named RBPJ and RBPJL.  <br><br>In Drosophila, Su(H) is known to be bifunctional, in that it represses target gene transcription in the absence of Notch signaling, but activates target genes during Notch signaling.  At least some of the mammalian CSL homologues are believed also to be bifunctional, and to mediate target gene repression in the absence of Notch signaling, and activation in the presence of Notch signaling.<br><br>Notch Co-Activator and Co-Repressor complexes: This repression is mediated by at least one specific co-repressor complexes (Co-R) bound to CSL in the absence of Notch signaling.  In Drosophila, this co-repressor complex consists of at least three distinct co-repressor proteins: Hairless, Groucho, and dCtBP (Drosophila C-terminal Binding Protein).  Hairless has been show to bind directly to Su(H), and Groucho and dCtBP have been shown to bind directly to Hairless (Barolo, 2002).  All three of the co-repressor proteins have been shown to be necessary for proper gene regulation during Notch signaling in vivo (Nagel, 2005).<br><br>In mammals, the same general pathway and mechanisms are observed, where CSL proteins are bifunctional DNA binding transcription factors (TFs), that bind to Co-Repressor complexes to mediate repression in the absence of Notch signaling, and bind to Co-Activator  complexes to mediate activation in the presence of Notch signaling.  However, in mammals, there may be multiple co-repressor complexes, rather than the single Hairless co-repressor complex that has been observed in Drosophila.  <br><br>During Notch signaling in all systems, the Notch transmembrane receptor is cleaved and the Notch intracellular domain (NICD) translocates to the nucleus, where it there functions as a specific transcription co-activator for CSL proteins.  In the nucleus, NICD replaces the Co-R complex bound to CSL, thus resulting in de-repression of  Notch target genes in the nucleus (Figure 2).  Once bound to CSL, NICD and CSL proteins recruit an additional co-activator protein, Mastermind, to form a CSL-NICD-Mam ternary co-activator (Co-A) complex.  This Co-R  complex was initially thought to be sufficient to mediate activation of  at least some Notch target genes.  However, there now is evidence that still other co-activators and additional DNA-binding transcription factors are required in at least some contexts (reviewed in Barolo, 2002).  <br><br>Thus, CSL is a good example of a bifunctional DNA-binding transcription factor that mediates repression of specific targets genes in one context, but activation of the same targets in another context.  This bifunctionality is mediated by the association of specific Co-Repressor complexes vs. specific Co-Activator complexes in different contexts, namely in the absence or presence of Notch signaling.\n View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=212436 Reactome].", "Pathway Ontology": "transcription pathway", "Summary": "The transcriptional regulation of gene expression in eukaryotic cells is a complex process involving multiple components and mechanisms.

The core promoter is a crucial region where the RNA polymerase II (Pol II) and general factors bind to specific DNA motifs, including the TATA box, Initiator motif, and Downstream Promoter Element. The proximal promoter region, located immediately upstream of the core promoter, contains functional DNA binding sites for transcription activator and repressor proteins, which are often cell- or tissue-specific in expression. Distal enhancer regions, located far from the promoter, also play a crucial role in regulating gene expression, often in a cell- or tissue-specific pattern.

Anterograde cargo from the ERGIC and ER is received at the cis-Golgi, trafficked through the medial- and trans-Golgi and released through the trans-Golgi network (TGN) to the endolysosomal system and the plasma membrane. Although still under debate, current models of Golgi trafficking favour the cisternal maturation model, where anterograde cargo remain associated with their original lipid membrane during transit through the Golgi and are exposed to sequential waves of processing enzymes by the retrograde movement of Golgi resident proteins. In this way, cis-cisterna mature to medial- and trans-cisterna as the early acting Golgi enzymes are replaced by later acting ones (reviewed in Pelham, 2001; Storrie, 2005; Glick and Nakano, 2009; Szul and Sztul, 2011).  More recently. a kiss-and-run (KAR) model for intra-Golgi trafficking has been proposed, which marries aspects of the cisternal maturation model with a diffusion model of transport (reviewed in Mironov et al, 2103).<br>Like the anterograde ERGIC-to Golgi transport step,  intra-Golgi trafficking between the cisterna appears to be COPI-dependent (Storrie and Nilsson, 2002; Szul and Sztul, 2011). Numerous snares and tethering complexes contribute to the targeting and fusion events that are required to maintain the specificity and directionality of these trafficking events (reviewed in Chia and Gleeson, 2014).  Golgi tethers include long coiled coiled proteins like the Golgins, as well as multisubunit tethers like the COG complex.

Gastrin release is induced by the gastrin-releasing peptide, a neurotransmitter acting on its basolateral receptor in G-cells. Gastrin is then translocated to the oxyntic mucosa in an endocrine manner where it binds to its receptor CCKBR in parietal and enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cells. This interaction stimulates secretion of gastric acid by parietal cells and release of histamine by ECL cells. Histamine reaches parietal cells through paracrine diffusion where it binds H2 receptors and induces gastric acid secretion. Gastrin has been reported to stimulate proliferation of gastric mucosal cells,maturation of parietal cells and enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cells, and promote islet differentiation in the pancreas. Gastrin is also known to stimulate the proliferation, invasion, and migration of cancer cells. Produced as preprogastrin of 101 amino acids by the human G-cells of the antrum of stomach, it is sequentially cleaved to first yield progastrin and then 35-amino acid gastrin-34-Gly or an 18-amino acid gastrin-17-Gly that are often amidated.\n\nCCKAR and CCKBR cholecystokinin receptors belonging to the family of G-protein coupled receptors, are the best characterized receptors of Gastrin. CCKBR has high affinity for gastrin and their carboxyl amidated analogues, while the CCKAR has been reported to have negligible affinity. Gq-alpha had been the major identified G-alpha subunit involved in gastrin signaling. Gastrin induces the activation of Gq-alpha and regulates the levels of IP3 and DAG through PLC-gamma1 mediated hydrolysis of PIP2. SRC has also been shown to be involved in this regulation. SRC kinase is also involved in the activation of classical RAS/MEK/ERK and PI3K/AKT pathways through IRS1-mediated recruitment of GRB2/SHC1/SOS complex and regulatory subunits of PI3Ks, respectively. PI3K pathway activation by SRC also involves the formation of SRC-FAK complexes. Gastrin induced MEK/ERK pathway is also reported to be mediated through PKCs. Gastrins have also been reported to regulate the activation of Rho, Rac and Cdc42 pathways. Recently, Liu and Jose 2013 have reported the regulation of MTOR and sodium-hydrogen exchanger 3 activities through a PI3K/PKC-dependent but AKT-independent pathway. Both p38MAPK and JNKs are also reported to be involved in gastrin signaling. PKAs as well as PKCs are involved in the regulation of p38MAPK activation whereas JNK activation has been shown to be mediated by MAP3K11 (MLK3). Gastrin induces the activation of eNOS and thereby nitric oxide production in ERK1/2, AKT, and p38MAPK dependent manner.

Binding of these stimuli to receptors in the plasma membrane promotes the GEF-mediated activation of RAS at the plasma membrane and initiates the three-tiered kinase cascade of the conventional MAPK cascades.  GTP-bound RAS recruits RAF (the MAPK kinase kinase), and promotes its dimerization and activation (reviewed in Cseh et al, 2014; Roskoski, 2010; McKay and Morrison, 2007; Wellbrock et al, 2004).  Activated RAF phosphorylates the MAPK kinase proteins MEK1 and MEK2 (also known as MAP2K1 and MAP2K2), which in turn phophorylate the proline-directed kinases ERK1 and 2 (also known as MAPK3 and MAPK1) (reviewed in Roskoski, 2012a, b; Kryiakis and Avruch, 2012).  Activated ERK proteins may undergo dimerization and have identified targets in both the nucleus and the cytosol; consistent with this, a proportion of activated ERK protein relocalizes to the nucleus in response to stimuli (reviewed in Roskoski 2012b; Turjanski et al, 2007; Plotnikov et al, 2010; Cargnello et al, 2011).  Although initially seen as a linear cascade originating at the plasma membrane and culminating in the nucleus, the RAS/RAF MAPK cascade is now also known to be activated from various intracellular location.

Primary KRAS mutations generally lead to a self-limiting hyperplastic or borderline lesion, but if they occur after a previous APC mutation it often progresses to cancer. KRAS mutation is predictive of a very poor response to panitumumab and cetuximab therapy in colorectal cancer.

TNF\u03b1 is mainly produced by macrophages, also by other tissues including lymphoid cells, mast cells, endothelial cells, fibroblasts and neuronal tissues. TNF was identified as a soluble cytokine produced upon the activation by the immune system and able to exert cytotoxicity on tumor cell lines and cause tumor necrosis in animal models. TNF is primarily produced as a type II transmembrane protein arranged as stable homotrimers. The members of TNF\u03b1 family exert their cellular effect through two distinct surface receptors of the TNF receptor family, TNFRSF1A (TNF-R1) and TNFRSF1B (TNF-R2). TNF-R1 is ubiquitously expressed, whereas TNF-R2 is found typically on cells of the immune system and is highly regulated. TNF-R1 and TNF-R2 binds membrane-integrated TNF (memTNF) as well as soluble TNF (sTNF) TNF-R1 contains a protein-protein interaction domain, called death domain (DD). This domain interacts with other DD-containing proteins and couples the death receptors to caspase activation and apoptosis. TNF-R2 induces gene expression by a TRAF-2 dependent signaling mechanism and also crosstalk's with TNF-R1. The pleiotropic biological effects of TNF can be attributed to its ability to simultaneously activate multiple signaling pathways in cells. Binding of TNF\u03b1 to TNF-R1 on the cell surface triggers trimerization of the receptor and exposes intracellular domain of TNF-R1 following the release of an inhibitory protein. This intracellular domain recruits a death-domain containing adaptor protein, TRADD by homophilic interactions. TRADD, which acts as a scaffold protein, recruits TRAF2 and RIPK1 to form a complex , referred to as complex 1.  Complex 1 is believed to be important in NF-\u03baB activation and JNK activation. Complex 1 eventually dissociates from the receptor and integrates FADD and procaspase8 to form a complex referred to as the complex 2. In some cases, FADD/CASP8 association depends on high molecular weight complexes containing unubiquitinated RIPK1 as scaffold. Activated CASP8 induces CASP3 activity and execution of apoptosis. CASP8 activates apoptotic signal through another mechanism involving BID cleavage to truncated BID (tBID). tBID translocates to the mitochondria, increasing its outer membrane permeability. This results in cytochrome C release and activation of other caspases ultimately leading to apoptosis. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been found to increase during or after complex 1 and 2 formation to mediate or potentiate apoptosis upon TNF stimulation. TRAF-2 in complex 1 also activates the MAP kinase cascade, that leads to the activation of JNK, which on prolonged activation is believed to mediate both apoptosis and necrotic cell death.  On complex 1 formation, NF-\u03baB regulated anti-apoptotic gene products efficiently block initiation of apoptosis by complex 2. There is evidence of an early attempt to signal for apoptosis, which precedes the activation of NF-\u03baB. The intracellular part of TNF-R1 binds to NSMAF which in turn mediates SMPD2-dependant ceramide production from cell membrane. Ceramide induces membrane permeabilization and apoptosis. This is observed before TNF-R1 internalization and NF-\u03baB activation. This process is repressed on TNF-R1 internalization. This signal however is enough to initiate apoptosis in some cells. Another form of cell death, necrosis, is also mediated through TNF stimulation. On TNF stimulation, deubiquitinated RIPK1 dissociates from complex 1 and recruits RIPK3, FADD and CASP8. RIPK3 is autophosphorylated and phosphorylates RIPK1. Taken together, it has been speculated that RIP1 and RIP3 increase carbohydrate and glutamine metabolism of the cell, leading to increased ROS production and eventual necrosis. Recruitment of CASP8, activation of FADD/RIP1 and apoptosis induction, is blunted when RIPK1 becomes ubiquitinated. IKBKG binds to ubiquitinated RIPK1 to induce the activation of NF-\u03baB, which exerts antiapoptotic effects. Cellular inhibitor of apoptosis, BIRC2 and BIRC3 has E3-ubiquitin ligase activity and functionally interact with TRAF2 and RIPK1  to induce polyubiquitination of RIPK1 upon TNF stimulation. Loss of these inhibitors attenuates TNF-induced NF-\u03baB activation. The adaptor proteins TAB2 and TAB3 bind preferentially to Lys-63 polyubiquitinated RIPK1. This facilitates dimerization of MAP3K7, promoting its phosphorylation and activation. The IKK complex, consisting of CHUK, IKBKB and IKBKG, is recruited to RIP1 through binding of IKBKG to the ubiquitin chain of RIP1. Activated TAK1 directly phosphorylates IKBKB within the activation loop, leading to activation of the IKK complex and NF-\u03baB. Certain regulatory proteins have been known to intercept NF-\u03baB activation at the level of ubiquitinated RIP1. TNFAIP3, an NF-\u03baB inhibitory protein, removes Lys-63 polyubiquitin chain and promotes Lys-48 linked ubiquitination of RIPK1 leading to its degradation and NF-\u03baB signal termination. IKBKG stabilizes the bound polyubiquitinated RIPK1 by inhibiting its degradation, most probably by impairing its interaction with TNFAIP3. OTUD7B is recruited to the activated TNF-R1 and promotes RIP1 deubiquitination, thereby attenuating NF-\u03baB activation. At internalized TNF-receptosomes, RIPK1 is ubiquitinated by endocytic vesicle associated RFFL, inducing RIPK1 degradation, which terminates NF-\u03baB activation. When successful, TNF-induced NF-\u03baB activation induces transcription and expression of genes encoding proinflammatory IL-6, anti-apoptotic factors BIRC2, BIRC3 and BCL-2 homologue BCL2L1. This causes the cell to remain inert to apoptotic stimuli.\n\nPlease access this pathway at [http://www.netpath.org/netslim/tnf_alpha_pathway.html NetSlim] database.\n\nProteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP231 CPTAC Assay Portal].", "Pathway Ontology": "tumor necrosis factor mediated signaling pathway", "Summary": "The tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF\u03b1) signaling pathway is a complex process involved in various biological processes, including regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and immune response.

The attachment of microtubules to kinetochores is a key event in the prometaphase, as it enables the chromosomes to be properly aligned and attached to the spindle apparatus, ultimately leading to the segregation of sister chromatids during anaphase. The prometaphase is a highly regulated process, with multiple checkpoints in place to ensure that chromosomes are properly attached to the spindle and aligned at the metaphase plate before the cell proceeds to anaphase."}, "WAG002185": {"NAME": "Oncostatin M signaling pathway", "LINK": "https://www.wikipathways.org/index.php/Pathway:WP2374", "WP_ID": "WP2374", "Description": "Oncostatin M (OSM) is a member of the multifunctional cytokine interleukin 6 (IL6) - type cytokine family.

OSM signaling is initiated by the interaction of the cytokine to either: the type I LIFR-gp130 receptor complex, or to the type II OSMR-gp130 receptor [O\u2019Hara et al]. The major downstream signaling pathways that are activated in OSM signaling are JAK/STAT, Ras/Raf/MAPK and PI3K pathways [Halfter, Halfter, Stross, Brantley].

Phosphorylated STATs form homodimeric complexes (STAT1, STAT3, STAT5B) or heterodimeric complex (STAT1-STAT3) and translocate to the nucleus.

These include cell-fate determination, tissue patterning and morphogenesis, cell differentiation, proliferation and cell death. The Notch pathway is named after the Drosophila mutants that showed irregular notches of missing tissue at the insect wing blade tips. The Notch gene was cloned in 1985. Proteins of the Notch families are single-pass transmembrane proteins that function both as cell surface receptors and nuclear transcriptional regulators. Four Notch receptors (Notch 1-4) have been identified in mammals. Mature Notch receptors are non-covalent heterodimers consisting of an extracellular subunit (NEC) and a transmembrane subunit (NTM). NEC possess multiple EGF-like repeats and three specialized Lin-Notch repeats (LNR) that forms a tight hydrophobic interaction with extracellular stump of NTM. This region masks an A disintegrin and metalloprotease (ADAM) cleavage site. The region where these two subunits interact is called the heterodimerization domain (HD). Notch ligands are also transmembrane proteins with multiple EGF-like repeats, a short cytoplasmic tail and a specialized delta-serrate-lag2 (DSL) domain at the N-terminus. There are five canonical Notch ligands i.e. Jagged (JAG1 and JAG2), Delta-like (DLL1, DLL3, DLL4) in mammals. Notch signaling activation occurs upon ligand-receptor binding, which are expressed on two adjacent cells. Ligand binding causes dissociation of NEC from NTM, unmasking the ADAM cleavage site. The NEC fragment is trans- endocytosed into the ligand expressing cells. The full-length receptor minus the NEC fragment is cleaved at the membrane by ADAM17 generating an intermediate, Notch extracellular truncation (NEXT). This is further cleaved by \u00ce\u00b3-secretase that generates an active Notch intracellular fragment (NIC) or Notch intracellular domain (NICD). The \u00ce\u00b3-secretase complex is composed of PSEN1, PSEN2, PSENEN, NCSTN and APH1 (A or B). Following these two cleavage steps, the NICD is released into the cytoplasm and translocates into the nucleus to regulate transcription of Notch target genes. Upon translocation into the nucleus, NICD binds to RBPJ which is a constitutive repressor of Notch signaling. RBPJ represses Notch target gene expression by recruiting a co-repressor complex, which includes NCOR1, NCOR2, SNW1, CIR, HDAC1, HDAC2, SPEN and FHL1 and SAP30. NICD binding to RBPJ replaces the co-repressor complex with a co-activator complex which includes MAML1-3, EP300 and SNW1. Primary Notch target genes include two families of transcriptional factors Hes, including HES1 and HES5 as well as Hey including HEY1 and HEY2. Other Notch target genes include CCND1, CDKN1A, GATA3 and PTCRA. CNTN1 acts as a functional ligand of Notch. This trans-extracellular interaction causes \u00ce\u00b3-secretase-dependent nuclear translocation of the NICD. This signaling is involved in oligodendrocyte precursor cell differentiation and upregulation of myelin-related protein MAG. In addition to the canonical Notch pathway, there is increasing evidence showing RBPJ independent non-canonical pathways. been fully characterized. Physical interaction of NOTCH-1IC with LCK- PI3K may mediate non-nuclear cross-talk with AKT, leading to survival signaling. Notch stimulation through AKT pathway leads to down regulation of MYC expression. Activation of SRC/STAT3 pathway by Notch signaling is dependent on the expression of Notch effector HES1 transcription factor. The induction of HES1 enhanced SRC phosphorylation. This activated SRC kinase was found to be responsible for the enhanced phosphorylation of STAT3. The HES1 and HES5 proteins associate with and facilitate the complex formation between JAK2 and STAT3, thus promoting STAT3 phosphorylation and activation. The activated STAT3 translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and induces transcriptional activation of target gene expression (including HIF1A).\n\nPlease access this pathway at [http://www.netpath.org/netslim/notch_pathway.html NetSlim] database.\n\nIf you use this pathway, please cite following paper:\nKandasamy, K., Mohan, S.

Prolactin has been established to be present in all vertebrates and involved in more than 300 different effects, which can be ascribed to six broad categories: (i) reproduction and lactation, (ii) growth and development, (iii) endocrinology and metabolism, (iv) brain and behaviour, (v) immunomodulation and (vi) osmoregulation. Prolactin mediates its multiple functions through prolactin receptor (PRLR), a member of class I cytokine receptor superfamily. The PRLR comprises of an extracellular ligand binding domain, a transmembrane domain and an intracellular domain. PRLR is expressed in a wide variety of tissues such as brain, mammary epithelium, liver, cerebellum and lymphocytes. Prolactin has been shown to be involved in the progression of different forms of cancer such as breast cancer and prostate cancer. Clinically, higher levels are found in patients with autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, multiple sclerosis, Reiter's syndrome and Sjogren's syndrome.

Prolactin associates with PRLR and induces the dimerization and activation of the receptor. The signaling reactions downstream of the long receptor isoform have been studied well and little is known about prolactin actions facilitated by short isoform. Since PRLR lacks intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity, it initiates signal transduction through its associated kinases in the cytoplasmic tail. PRL signaling activate Janus kinase 2 (JAK2), mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK), Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3- kinase), Src kinase and serine/threonine kinase Nek3-vav2-Rac1 pathways through the long isoform of the receptor. The prolactin signaling through short isoform can activate different downstream cascades except JAK/STAT pathway. JAK2 phosphorylates multiple tyrosine residues of the receptor PRLR and enables the binding of downstream signaling molecules mainly signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) proteins. The STATs are considered as major effectors for PRL-dependent cell proliferation and gene activation, with STAT5 serving as the primary mediators. The phosphorylated STAT proteins dimmerize, translocate to the nucleus, and bind to specific DNA sequences in the promoters of PRL-induced genes, activating gene transcription. Prolactin signaling also activates MAP kinase pathways and is reported to be involved in proliferation of normal and mammary tumor cells.

This complex participates in T-cell activation upon the presentation of the antigen peptide (derived from the foreign antigen) bound to the MHC (Class I and Class II) residing on antigen-presenting cells (APCs), including dendritic cells, macrophages and B cells. Co-stimulatory receptors, such as CD2, CD28, CD4, CD8, and integrin molecules, contribute to signal transduction by modulating the response threshold. All the above components along with accessory proteins essential for MHC are a part of the immunological synapse that initiates T-cell activation.\n\nProtein tyrosine phosphorylation mediated by the Src family kinases Lck and Fyn, in turn regulated by CD45, is the initial event in TCR signaling. Lck is activated by the interaction of MHC and CD4 or CD8. It then induces the phosphorylation and activation of TCR-CD3 complex and eventually mediates Fyn activation. The activated Src kinases phosphorylate ITAMs (Immune receptor tyrosine-based activation motifs) present on CD3\u03b3, \u03b4, \u03b5 and \u03b6 chain. The 70-kd \u03b6 chain\u2013associated protein kinase (ZAP70) is then recruited to the ITAMs followed by its phosphorylation and subsequent activation which results in further amplification of the response. These activated PTKs induce tyrosine phosphorylation of several polypeptides, including the transmembrane adaptor LAT (Linker Activator for T-Cells). Protein tyrosine phosphorylation subsequently leads to the activation of multiple pathways, including ERK (Extracellular Signal Regulated Kinase), JNK (c-Jun N-terminal Kinase), NF-\u03baB (Nuclear factor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells 1) and NFAT(Nuclear Factor of Activated T-Cells) pathways, which ultimately induce effector functions.\n\nCD28 ligation by B7-1 or B7-2 helps in bringing the T-Cell and Antigen Presenting Cell membranes into close proximity. This event also provides a co-stimulatory signal leading to the production of IL-2 and T- cell activation. Besides CD28, many other transmembrane receptors also modulate specific elements of TCR signaling. CD28 and CD45 activate Lck which in turn induces the phosphorylation and activation of the TCR-CD3 complex and consequently, the tyrosine kinases Fyn and ZAP70. CD45 plays a role in antagonizing the effect of inhibitory proteins on T-cell activation. ZAP70 induces activation of LAT (Linker for Activation of T-Cells), an integral membrane adaptor protein which further binds to GADS (Growth Factor Receptor-Bound Protein-2-Related Adaptor Protein-2), SLP76 (SH2 Domain-Containing Leukocyte Protein-76), and ITK (IL-2 inducible T-cell kinase). This complex facilitates the activation of PLCG1 (Phospholipase-C-Gamma1) that is responsible for the production of the second messengers DAG (Diacylglycerol) and IP3 (Inositol Triphosphate). DAG activates proteins including PKC\u03b8 (Protein Kinase-C-Theta) and Ras, whereas IP3 leads to Ca2+ release from ER and also facilitates influx of extracellular calcium. Increased intracellular Ca2+ activates the phosphatase Calcineurin that dephosphorylates NFAT which then enters the nucleus and promotes transcription.\n\nActivated LAT also binds multiple adaptor proteins including GRB2, GRAP (GRB2- Related Adaptor Protein) and GADS to facilitate activation of serine/threonine kinases such as Raf1, MEK (MAPK/ERK Kinase) and dual-specificity kinases ERK1/2 that are involved in activation of MAPKs (Mitogen activated protein kinases) resulting in the induction of transcription factor Elk1.\n\nZAP70 also activates IKKs via the CARD11 (Caspase recruitment domain family, member 11) -BCL10 (B-Cell CLL/lymphoma-10)-MALT1 (Mucosa Associated Lymphoid Tissue Lymphoma Translocation Gene-1) complex and MAP3K (activated by PKC\u03b8) which in turn relieve NF-\u03baB of I\u03baB (NF-kappa-B inhibitor beta) and allow its nuclear translocation and transcriptional activation. ZAP70 also activates p38 via Vav, Rac and MKK3/6 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinase-3 / Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinase-6). p38 then activates the transcription factor ATF2 (Activating Transcription Factor-2).  Activated Rac also activates JNK via MEKK1 and MKK4/7 (MKK4 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinase-4/ Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinase-7) which eventually leads to activation of c-Jun mediated transcription.\n\nSIT (SHP2-Interacting Transmembrane Adaptor Protein) and CTLA4 (Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte Antigen-4) are transmembrane adaptor proteins that interact with the SHP2 (SH2-containing Protein tyrosine Phosphatase-2) and negatively regulate T-cell activation by inhibiting the phosphorylation of Fyn and CD28 respectively. CTLA4 has a greater affinity for its B7-1/B7-2ligands in comparison toCD28 and thus competes for them. During T-cell activation CTLA4 is endocytosed to quicken the response. ZAP70 facilitates translocation of CTLA4 to the membrane when the response needs to be controlled. PAG (Phosphoprotein Associated with Glycosphingolipid Microdomains), a transmembrane adaptor molecule is associated with CSK (c-Src Tyrosine Kinase), an inhibitor of Src-related protein tyrosine kinases. Overexpression of PAG inhibits TCR-mediated responses.  Dual specificity phosphatase 3 (DUSP3) or VHR is also induced by ZAP70 which consequently down regulates ERK activation and thus controls T-cell response.\n\nPlease access this pathway at [http://www.netpath.org/netslim/tcr_pathway.html NetSlim] database.", "Cell Type": "T cell", "Pathway Ontology": "T cell receptor signaling pathway", "Summary": "The T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling pathway is a complex process initiated by the interaction between T-cells and antigen-presenting cells (APCs) through the TCR complex.

CME contributes to signal transduction by regulating the cell surface expression and signaling of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs).  Most RTKs exhibit a robust increase in internalization rate after binding specific ligands; however, some RTKs may also exhibit significant ligand-independent internalization (reviewed in Goh and Sorkin, 2013). CME controls RTK and GPCR signaling by organizing signaling both within the plasma membrane and on endosomes (reviewed in Eichel et al, 2016; Garay et al, 2015; Vieira et al, 1996; Sorkin and von Zastrow, 2014; Di Fiori and von Zastrow, 2014; Barbieri et al, 2016). CME also contributes to the uptake of material such as metabolites, hormones and other proteins from the extracellular space, and regulates membrane composition by recycling membrane components and/or targeting them for degradation. <br><br><br>Clathrin-mediated endocytosis involves initiation of clathrin-coated pit (CCP) formation, cargo selection, coat assembly and stabilization, membrane scission and vesicle uncoating.  Although for simplicity in this pathway, the steps leading to a mature CCP are represented in a linear and temporally distinct fashion, the formation of a clathrin-coated vesicle is a highly heterogeneous process and clear temporal boundaries between these processes may not exist (see for instance Taylor et al, 2011; Antonescu et al, 2011; reviewed in Kirchhausen et al, 2014). Cargo selection in particular is a critical aspect of the formation of a mature and stable CCP, and many of the proteins involved in the initiation and maturation of a CCP contribute to cargo selection and are themselves stabilized upon incorporation of cargo into the nascent vesicle (reviewed in Kirchhausen et al, 2014; McMahon and Boucrot, 2011).<br><br><br><br>Although the clathrin triskelion was identified early as a major component of the coated vesicles, clathrin does not bind directly to membranes or to the endocytosed cargo.  Vesicle formation instead relies on many proteins and adaptors that can bind the plasma membrane and interact with cargo molecules. Cargo selection depends on the recognition of endocytic signals in cytoplasmic tails of the cargo proteins by adaptors that interact with components of the vesicle's inner coat.  The classic adaptor for clathrin-coated vesicles is the tetrameric AP-2 complex, which along with clathrin was identified early as a major component of the coat.  Some cargo indeed bind directly to AP-2, but subsequent work has revealed a large family of proteins collectively known as CLASPs (clathrin- associated sorting proteins) that mediate the recruitment of diverse cargo into the emerging clathrin-coated vesicles (reviewed in Traub and Bonifacino, 2013).  Many of these CLASP proteins themselves interact with AP-2 and clathrin, coordinating cargo recruitment with coat formation (Schmid et al, 2006; Edeling et al, 2006; reviewed in Traub and Bonifacino, 2013; Kirchhausen et al, 2014).  <br><br><br>Initiation of CCP formation is also influenced by lipid composition, regulated by clathrin-associated phosphatases and kinases (reviewed in Picas et al, 2016). The plasma membrane is enriched in PI(4,5)P2.  Many of the proteins involved in initiating clathrin-coated pit formation bind to PI(4,5)P2 and induce membrane curvature through their BAR domains (reviewed in McMahon and Boucrot, 2011; Daumke et al, 2014).  Epsin also contributes to early membrane curvature through its Epsin N-terminal homology (ENTH) domain, which promotes membrane curvature by inserting into the lipid bilayer (Ford et al, 2002). <br><br>Following initiation, some CCPs progress to formation of vesicles, while others undergo disassembly at the cell surface without producing vesicles (Ehrlich et al, 2004; Loerke et al, 2009; Loerke et al, 2011; Aguet et al, 2013; Taylor et al, 2011). The assembly and stabilization of nascent CCPs is regulated by several proteins and lipids (Mettlen et al, 2009; Antonescu et al, 2011).<br><br><br>Maturation of the emerging clathrin-coated vesicle is accompanied by further changes in the lipid composition of the membrane and increased membrane curvature, promoted by the recruitment of N-BAR domain containing proteins (reviewed in Daumke et al, 2014; Ferguson and De Camilli, 2012; Picas et al, 2016). Some N-BAR domain containing proteins also contribute to the recruitment of the large GTPase dynamin, which is responsible for scission of the mature vesicle from the plasma membrane (Koh et al, 2007; Lundmark and Carlsson, 2003; Soulet et al, 2005; David et al, 1996; Owen et al, 1998; Shupliakov et al, 1997; Taylor et al, 2011; Ferguson et al, 2009; Aguet et al, 2013; Posor et al, 2013; Chappie et al, 2010; Shnyrova et al, 2013; reviewed in Mettlen et al, 2009; Daumke et al, 2014).  After vesicle scission, the clathrin coat is dissociated from the new vesicle by the ATPase HSPA8 (also known as HSC70) and its DNAJ cofactor auxilin, priming the vesicle for fusion with a subsequent endocytic compartment and releasing clathrin for reuse  (reviewed in McMahon and Boucrot, 2011; Sousa and Laufer, 2015).\n View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=8856828 Reactome].", "Pathway Ontology": "clathrin-mediated endocytosis pathway && regulatory pathway", "Summary": "Clathrin-mediated endocytosis is a process that controls the uptake of material from the plasma membrane, leading to the formation of clathrin-coated vesicles.

Cilium biogenesis involves the anchoring of the basal body, a centriole-derived organelle, near the plasma membrane and the subsequent polymerization of the microtubule-based axoneme and extension of the plasma membrane (reviewed in Ishikawa and Marshall, 2011; Reiter et al, 2012). Although the ciliary membrane is continuous with the plasma membrane, the protein and lipid content of the cilium and the ciliary membrane are distinct from those of the bulk cytoplasm and plasma membrane (reviewed in Emmer et al, 2010; Rohatgi and Snell, 2010).

Ciliary components are targeted from the secretory system to the ciliary base and subsequently transported to the ciliary tip, where extension of the axoneme occurs, by a motor-driven process called intraflagellar transport (IFT).

A structural homologue of rad3 in humans has been identified based on sequence similarity in the protein kinase domain.  ATR (for Ataxia Telangiectasia and Rad3-related) is considered the mammalian counterpart of yeast rad3, Mec1p, and fruit fly Mei-41, proteins involved in DNA damage responses.\nThe ATR protein is a member of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase related kinase family and plays an important role in UV-induced DNA damage checkpoint response and its role as a signal transducer in cell cycle checkpoint has been well established.  Even though it is currently unclear whether ATR functions as a damage sensor, recent evidence shows that ATR may function as an initial sensor in the DNA damage checkpoint response.  Moreover, it has been found that ATR is a DNA-binding protein with higher affinity to UV-damaged than undamaged DNA.  In addition, damaged DNA stimulates the kinase activity of ATR to a significantly higher level than undamaged DNA.\nATR is structurally related to ATM (for Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated) as well as the yeast PIK family members Mec1p and Rad3.  Mec1p and Rad3 participate in checkpoint pathways induced by DNA replication blocks, DNA strand breaks, and other chromosomal abnormalities, which implies that ATR performs similar functions in mammalian cells.

The checkpoint defects observed in ATR-overexpressing cells resemble those found in AT cells.\nAdditionally, ATR functions as an upstream regulator of p53 phosphorylation in DNA-damaged cells.  ATR phosphorylates p53 at both Ser-15 and Ser-37 in vitro, suggesting that ATR is directly involved in the modification of p53 in DNA-damaged cells.  Recent reports concerning ATM, suggest that ATR and ATM play both overlapping and independent roles in the phosphorylation of p53 during cellular exposure to genotoxic stress.\nAtr is localized to the nuclei of primary spermatocytes, cells that are undergoing meiosis I.

Major aspects of the heat shock response (HSR) are evolutionarily conserved events that allow cells to recover from protein damage induced by stress (Liu XD et al. 1997; Voellmy R & Boellmann F 2007;  Shamovsky I & Nudler E 2008; Anckar J & Sistonen L 2011). The main hallmark of HSR is the dramatic alteration of the gene expression pattern. A diverse group of protein genes is induced by the exposure to temperatures 3-5 degrees higher than physiological. Functionally, most of these genes are molecular chaperones that ensure proper protein folding and quality control to maintain cell proteostasis.<p>At the same time, heat shock-induced phosphorylation of translation initiation factor eIF2alpha leads to the shutdown of the nascent polypeptide synthesis reducing the burden on the chaperone system that has to deal with the increased amount of misfolded and thermally denatured proteins (Duncan RF & Hershey JWB 1989; Sarkar A et al. 2002;  Spriggs KA et al. 2010).<p>The induction of HS gene expression primarily occurs at the level of transcription and is mediated by heat shock transcription factor HSF1(Sarge KD et al. 1993; Baler R et al. 1993). Human cells express five members of HSF protein family: HSF1, HSF2, HSF4, HSFX and HSFY. HSF1 is the master regulator of the heat inducible gene expression (Zuo J et al. 1995; Akerfelt M et al. 2010). HSF2 is activated in response to certain developmental stimuli in addition to being co-activated with HSF1 to provide promoter-specific fine-tuning of the HS response by forming heterotrimers with HSF1 (Ostling P et al. 2007; Sandqvist A et al. 2009). HSF4 lacks the transcription activation domain and acts as a repressor of certain genes during HS (Nakai A et al. 1997; Tanabe M et al. 1999; Kim SA et al. 2012). Two additional family members HSFX and HSFY, which are  located on the X and Y chromosomes respectively, remain to be characterized (Bhowmick BK et al. 2006; Shinka T et al. 2004; Kichine E et al. 2012).<p>Under normal conditions HSF1 is present in both cytoplasm and nucleus in the form of an inactive monomer. The monomeric state of HSF1 is maintained by an intricate network of protein-protein interactions that include the association with HSP90 multichaperone complex, HSP70/HSP40 chaperone machinery, as well as intramolecular interaction of two conserved hydrophobic repeat regions. Monomeric HSF1 is constitutively phosphorylated on Ser303 and Ser 307 by (Zou J et al. 1998; Knauf U et al. 1996; Kline MP & Moromoto RI 1997; Guettouche T et al. 2005). This phosphorylation plays an essential role in ensuring cytoplasmic localization of at least a subpopulation of HSF1 molecules under normal conditions (Wang X et al. 2004).<p>Exposure to heat and other proteotoxic stimuli results in the release of HSF1 from the inhibitory complex with chaperones and its subsequent trimerization, which is promoted by its interaction with translation elongation factor eEF1A1 (Baler R et al. 1993; Shamovsky I et al. 2006; Herbomel G et al 2013). The trimerization is believed to involve intermolecular interaction between hydrophobic repeats 1-3 leading to the formation of a triple coil structure. Additional stabilization of the HSF1 trimer is provided by the formation of intermolecular S-S bonds between Cys residues in the DNA binding domain (Lu M et al.2008). Trimeric HSF1 is predominantly localized in the nucleus where it binds the specific sequence in the promoter of hsp genes (Sarge KD et al. 1993; Wang Y and Morgan WD 1994). The binding sequence for HSF1 (HSE, heat shock element) contains series of inverted repeats nGAAn in head-to-tail orientation, with at least three elements being required for the high affinity binding. Binding of the HSF1 trimer to the promoter is not sufficient to induce transcription of the gene (Cotto J et al. 1996). In order to do so, HSF1 needs to undergo inducible phosphorylation on specific Ser residues such as Ser230, Ser326. This phosphorylated form of HSF1 trimer is capable of increasing the promoter initiation rate. HSF1 bound to DNA promotes recruiting components of the transcription mediator complex and  relieving promoter-proximal pause of RNA polymerase II through its interaction with TFIIH transcription factor (Yuan CX & Gurley WB 2000).<p>HSF1 activation is regulated in a precise and tight manner at multiple levels (Zuo J et al. 1995; Cotto J et al. 1996). This allows fast and robust activation of HS response to minimize proteotoxic effects of the stress. The exact set of HSF1 inducible genes is probably cell type specific. Moreover, cells in different pathophysiological states will display different but overlapping profile of HS inducible genes.\n View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=3371556 Reactome].", "Pathway Ontology": "stress response pathway", "Summary": "The heat shock response is a conserved cellular mechanism that allows cells to recover from protein damage induced by stress, such as elevated temperature, hypoxia, and free radicals.

It is also expressed in other tissues including placenta, stomach and skeletal muscle. Leptin mediates its effects by binding to its receptor, leptin receptor (LEPR). LEPR belongs to gp130 family of cytokine receptor. LEPR is expressed in many tissues such as brain, adipose tissue, heart, placenta, lung and liver. Alternative splicing of LEPR results in six different isoforms, LEPRa, LEPRb, LEPRc, LEPRd, LEPRe and LEPRf. LEPRb is the longest isoform and possess signaling capacity. The role of other isoforms in leptin signaling is not clear. Leptin plays a major role in the regulation of energy homeostasis and regulate food intake and energy expenditure. Leptin is found to be transported to various regions of the brain across blood brain barrier. Impairment in leptin signaling across the blood brain barrier induces leptin resistance and thus obesity. Leptin is known to regulate reproduction, bone homeostasis and immune signaling. Leptin is also implicated in various physiological processers such as angiogenesis and hematopoiesis. LEPRb forms a homodimer and binds to leptin in 1:1 stoichiometry. This tetrameric receptor/ ligand complex appears to be essential for signaling. Leptin receptor lacks intrinsic kinase activity. It mediates multiple signaling pathways by binding to cytoplasmic kinases such as Janus Kinase 2 (JAK2). Activation of JAK2 by leptin promotes the tyrosine phosphorylation of LEPRb at Tyr-986, Try-1078 and Tyr-1141, thus activating LEPRb. Activation of leptin receptor with leptin activates signaling modules such as JAK/STAT, RAS/RAF/MAPK, IRS1/PI-3K, PLC\u03b3 and AMPK/ACC modules. Tyrosine phosphorylation of LEPRb induces binding of STATs to LEPRb. Binding of STATs to the phosphorylated residues of LEPR leads to the JAK2 mediated tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of STATs. Activated STATs translocate to the nucleus and induces expression of genes such as suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) and TIMP metallopeptidase inhibitor 1 (TIMP1). SOCS3 mediates feedback inhibition of leptin pathway by binding to Tyr-986 residue of LEPR. Cytosolic PTP1B also negatively regulates leptin pathway by dephosphorylating JAK2 and STAT3. Binding of leptin to its receptor results in the phosphorylation of PTPN1. Phosphorylated PTPN11 provides a docking site for GRB2, resulting in the activation of ERK module through RAS-RAF-MEK signaling. Leptin induces the activation of PI-3K by promoting the interaction and formation of SH2B/JAK2/IRS complex. Activation PI-3K mediates the activation of activation of protein kinases such as protein kinase B (AKT1) and downstream signaling cascades such as mammalian target of rapamycin (MTOR), nitric oxide synthase 3 (NOS3) and phosphodiesterase 3A, cGMP-inhibited (PDE3A). Activated AKT also regulates glycogen synthase kinase 3 alpha/beta (GSK3A/B) proteins. IkappaB kinases (IKKs) are activated in response to AKT activation. Activated IKKs induce nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB. Leptin also regulates 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling. AMPK function as energy sensor and is activated in response to rise in AMP to ATP ratio. Activated AMPK regulate fatty acid biosymthesis by regulating the activity the enzyme, fatty acid biosynthesis-acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC). PLC gamma is activated in response to leptin signaling. Activated PLC gamma regulate intracellular calcium levels and also protein kinase C activation by hydrolysing phospholipid phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG).\n\nPlease access this pathway at [http://www.netpath.org/netslim/Leptin_pathway.html NetSlim] database.\nIf you use this pathway, please cite the following paper: Nanjappa, V., Raju, R., Muthusamy, B., Sharma, J., Thomas, J.

Osteoblasts differentiate from mesenchymal progenitors (MP) through distinct developmental stages marked by expression of key transcription factors including SOX9, RUNX2, and OSX. Mature osteoblasts (OB) can further differentiate to osteocytes (OCY) or bone lining cells (not depicted) or undergo apoptosis (not depicted).\n\nIndian hedgehog (IHH) signaling is required for osteoblast differentiation during endochondral bone development. IHH binding to the receptor Patched homolog 1 (PTCH1) activates signaling through Smoothened (SMO), thereby inhibiting the generation of the proteolytically cleaved GLI3 repressor (GLI3R) and promoting the generation of the full-length GLI2 activator (GLI2A). Whereas derepression of GLI3R is sufficient to generate RUNX2+ cells, both derepression of GLI3R and activation of GLI2A are necessary for progression to the RUNX2+OSX+ stage. NOTCH signaling inhibits osteoblast differentiation. Following binding to their ligands, Jagged (JAG) or Delta-like (DLL), Notch receptors are proteolytically cleaved by the g-secretase complex, leading to release of the Notch intracellular domain (NICD) from the plasma membrane.

WNTcan also signal independently of LRP5/6 and b-catenin through protein kinase Cd (PKCd), promoting progression to the RUNX2+OSX+ stage through an unknown mechanism.\n\nBone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling stimulates osteoblast differentiation and function. Binding of BMP2 or BMP4 to their receptors results in phosphorylation of SMAD1, SMAD5, or SMAD8. These can then form a complex with their partner, SMAD4, and enter the nucleus to regulate gene expression, ultimately promoting the transition to RUNX2+OSX+ cells and enhancing the function of mature osteoblasts; however, a direct role for SMAD signaling in osteoblast differentiation remains to be shown.\n\nFibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling has diverse roles in osteoblast lineage cells.

It is also expressed in adrenal gland, placenta, testis, spleen, gut, thymus and skin. CRH is the principal mediator of endocrine stress response. CRH also plays a significant role in inflammatory responses, hemodynamic actions, stromal cell decidualization during estrus cycle, implantation of blastocyst, maintenance of pregnancy, onset of labor  and neuroprotection. Excess secretion of CRH during severe depression and its association with increased levels of cortisol have been observed. CRH has also been reported to be involved in anxiety disorders, anorexia nervosa. Decrease in cortical CRH content has been observed in Alzheimer's disease  and Parkinson's disease.\n\nThe actions of CRH are mediated through class II/secretin-like family type of G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) called the CRH receptors (CRHR). CRH is a high affinity ligand of CRHR1 and also binds to CRHR2 but with lower affinity. CRH receptors do not have any intrinsic kinase activity and transduce the signal via the heterotrimeric G-proteins. The CRH receptors are rapidly desensitized by G-protein-coupled receptor kinase (GRK) and \u00ce\u00b2-arrestin mechanisms in the presence of high concentrations of CRH. Binding of CRH to CRH receptor induces a conformational change in the receptor by activating it. This further activates G\u00ce\u00b1-subunit and its subsequent dissociation from the G\u00ce\u00b2\u00ce\u00b3 dimer. CRH receptors on interaction with G\u00ce\u00b1-subunit of different G-proteins such as G\u00ce\u00b1s, G\u00ce\u00b1i/o, G\u00ce\u00b1q/11 activate numerous downstream signaling cascades and result in the induction of various cellular responses. The pathways that are activated upon CRH stimulation are: Adenylate cyclase/cAMP/PKA, PLC/PKC, ERK/MAPK, PI3K-AKT and NF-kappa B. \n\nCRH binding to CRHR1 couples G-stimulatory (Gs) protein which in turn activates cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). Activation of PKA leads to the phosphorylation of transcription factors like cAMP response element binding protein (CREB), which in turn increases the expression of pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) gene and the release of POMC-derived peptides, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and \u00ce\u00b2-endorphin. ACTH, in turn, stimulates the secretion of glucocorticoids from adrenal glands and thereby mediates changes associated with stress response. CREB also regulates genes containing the Ca2+/cAMP response element such as FOS. The activation of cAMP by CRH induces the mRNA expression and transcription of orphan nuclear receptors NR4A1 and NR4A2, which in turn transcriptionally activates the expression of POMC. Activation of cAMP/PKA can also induce the expression of enzymes involved in dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate and cortisol production. The biological functions of CRH are also mediated by MAPK family, in particular MAPK1/3 and MAPK14. MAPK1/3 mediates activation of transcription factors NR4A1 and NR4A2 and induction of POMC in corticotrophs. MAPK14 is involved in CRH-induced inhibition of IL-18 expression in human keratinocytes. The CRHR1/PKA/ERK signaling activate the transcription factors - ELK1, SP1 and TFAP2A. SP1 and TFAP2A up-regulates the expression of ADRBK2, which causes the desensitization of CRHR1 receptors.\n\nThe PLC/PKC pathway is activated by coupling of the CRH receptors to the G\u00ce\u00b1q/11 proteins. This cascade stimulates the formation of IP3 and contributes to the mobilization of intracellular calcium. Calcium is involved in the transcription regulation of FOS as well as NR4A1 and NR4A2 through CAMK2A. PLC/PKC is involved in the activation of AP-1 complex and subsequent transcriptional regulation of genes involved in keratinocyte differentiation and proliferation \u00e2\u20ac\u201c KRT1, KRT14 and IVL. This cascade also inhibits the expression of CYP11A1 and HSD3B1, the genes involved in progesterone synthesis in placental trophoblasts. \nAnother important signaling pathway activated upon CRH stimulation is the nitric oxide (NO)/cGMP, involved in the control of vascular tone. In human keratinocytes, upon CRH stimulation, NFKBIA degradation is diminished and the activity of NFKB is inhibited resulting in the down-regulation of NFKB-dependent genes IL2 and HSP90AA1 and inhibition of cell proliferation. The gene involved in cell survival, BCL2 is transcriptionally regulated via the PI3K/AKT. \nPlease access this pathway at [http://www.netpath.org/netslim/CRH_pathway.html NetSlim] database.\n\nProteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP2355 CPTAC Assay Portal]", "Disease": "major depressive disorder && Alzheimer's disease && Parkinson's disease && anorexia nervosa", "Pathway Ontology": "corticotropin-releasing hormone signaling pathway", "Summary": "Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) is a neuropeptide that plays a crucial role in the endocrine stress response and various physiological processes.

Both Ig\u00ce\u00b1 and Ig\u00ce\u00b2 proteins have an immunoreceptor tyrosine -based activation motif (ITAM) each in its cytoplasmic region, which is responsible for the initiation and propagation of signaling. Antigen binding to the immunoglubulin results in the aggregation of both the immunoglobulin and the Ig\u00ce\u00b1/\u00ce\u00b2 subunits. This results in the phosphorylation of the tyrosine residues in the ITAM motif of the Ig\u00ce\u00b1/\u00ce\u00b2 subunits by the src-family of protein tyrosine kinases Lyn and Syk. The Src family kinases are initially in the proximity of the BCR as a result of membrane anchoring by virtue of its their acetylation. The N-terminal region of the kinases can also interact with the non-phosphorylated ITAMs of Ig\u00ce\u00b1. This association is further enhanced upon BCR engagement as a result of accumulation in BCR containing lipid rafts and SH2 domain mediated binding to the phosphorylated tyrosine residues in ITAMs. This increased association helps in amplifying the BCR mediated signaling. Doubly phosphorylated Ig\u00ce\u00b1/\u00ce\u00b2 ITAMs are necessary for efficient recruitment of Syk and its activation. Activated Syk then phsophorylates the adapter molecule B cell linker protein (BLNK), which acts as molecular scaffold for the recruitment of multiple effectors and hence the propagation of multiple signaling pathways. BLNK binds to Btk and PLC\u00ce\u00b32 which results in optimal phosphorylation and activation of PLC. This is an important mechanism which links BCR to Ca2+ signaling. Apart from the PLC mediated Ca2+ signaling, BCR triggering also results in the the activaion of phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI-3K). This activation takes place through the recruitment of p85 adaptor subunit of PI-3K to CD19 co-receptor, which is phosphorylated by Lyn on its cytoplasmic Y-X-X-M motif. Alternatively, PI-3K can be recruited to the plasma membrane by other adapter molecules including PIK3AP, CBL or GAB1/2. PI-3K catalyzes the phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate to phosphatidyl inositol 3,4,5-bisphosphate. Akt, a serine threonine kinase, is recruited to the plasma membrane by virtue of its N-terminal PH-domain where it is activated by conformational changes and phosphorylation. Activated Akt phosphorylates several substrates resulting in diverse physiological consequences: Forkhead transcription factors - resulting in its degradation and hence inhibition of expression of pro-apoptotic genes, glycogen synthase kinase-3 GSK3 -leading to its inhibition and hence regulation of cell-cycle. The tanscription factor NF-kappaB is also found to be activated in BCR signaling in a Btk, PI-3K and PKC dependent manner. \nBCR engagement can also result in the association of GRB2/SOS complex with either SHC or BLNK, which results in the activation of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling cascade.

It is expressed by fibroblasts and endothelial cells throughout the body, promoting proliferation, migration, survival and differentiation of hematopoetic progenitors, melanocytes and germ cells.(Linnekin 1999, Ronnstrand 2004, Lennartsson and Ronnstrand 2006). The receptor for SCF is KIT, a tyrosine kinase receptor (RTK) closely related to the receptors for platelet derived growth factor receptor, colony stimulating factor 1 (Linnekin 1999) and Flt3 (Rosnet et al. 1991).  Four isoforms of c-Kit have been identified in humans. Alternative splicing results in isoforms of KIT differing in the presence or absence of four residues (GNNK) in the extracellular region. This occurs due to the use of an alternate 5' splice donor site. These GNNK+ and GNNK- variants are co-expressed in most tissues; the GNNK- form predominates and was more strongly tyrosine-phosphorylated and more rapidly internalized (Ronnstrand 2004). There are also splice variants that arise from alternative usage of splice acceptor site resulting in the presence or absence of a serine residue (Crosier et al., 1993). Finally, there is an alternative shorter transcript of KIT expressed in postmeiotic germ cells in the testis  which encodes a truncated KIT consisting only of the second part of the kinase domain and thus lackig the extracellular and transmembrane domains as well as the first part of the kinase domain (Rossi et al. 1991). Binding  of SCF homodimers to KIT results in KIT homodimerization followed by activation of its intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity. KIT stimulation activates a wide array of signalling pathways including MAPK, PI3K and JAK/STAT (Reber et al. 2006, Ronnstrand 2004).

DHT binds the receptor with high affinity compared to testosterone. The AR gene is located in the X chromosome at Xq11-12 site. AR is cytosolic protein, which in the ligand unbound state, is present as a complex with various Heat shock proteins primarily Hsp70, 90 and 56 as well as p23. Upon ligand binding, it dissociates from the complex. AR is found to be expressed in a number of tissues and cells including prostate, testis, seminal vesicle, epididymis, skin, skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle, liver and central nervous system. The protein has four functional domains- an N terminal domain (NTD), a DNA binding domain (DBD), a hinge region and a Ligand binding Domain (LBD). The DBD is a 658 amino acid residue region that has ZNF motifs which allows it bind to DNA. The rest of the domains are involved in dimerization and ligand binding. Two phosphorylation events are proposed to play very important role in the activation of the receptor upon ligand binding. The first phosphorylation event releases the ligand binding domain for hormone binding. The subsequent phosphorylation event is triggered upon hormone binding. Activated AR upon ligand binding undergoes conformational change to form a homodimer and interacts tightly with the Androgen Response Element (ARE). The androgen receptor is known to bind to many co-regulators at different time points and in different cell types. This DNA protein complex triggers the expression of various target genes that are associated with the male phenotype. Modulation of the AR activity is carried out by several transcription factors like ARA70, TR4, SRC family members and CBP/p300 and other associated proteins. FXXLF and WXXLF motifs containing coactivators such as the p160 members bind with the AF2 region of the Ligand Binding Domain of the AR. Androgen receptors are known to induce apoptosis under certain conditions. Various regulators that regulate androgen induced apoptosis include BRCA1 and Smad3 and Akt.

TNF-alpha interacts with two receptors, namely TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1) and TNF receptor 2 (TNFR2). Activation of TNFR1 can trigger multiple signal transduction pathways inducing inflammation, proliferation, survival or cell death (Ward C et al. 1999; Micheau O and Tschopp J 2003; Widera D et al. 2006). Whether a TNF-alpha-stimulated cell will survive or die is dependent on autocrine/paracrine signals, and on the cellular context.<p>TNF binding to TNFR1 results initially in the formation of complex I that consists of TNFR1, TRADD (TNFR1-associated death domain), TRAF2 (TNF receptor associated factor-2), RIPK1 (receptor-interacting serin/threonine protein kinase 1), and E3 ubiquitin ligases BIRC2,BIRC3 (cIAP1/2,cellular inhibitor of apoptosis) and LUBAC (Micheau O and Tschopp J 2003). The conjugation of ubiquitin chains by BIRC2/3 and LUBAC (composed of HOIP, HOIL-1 and SHARPIN ) to RIPK1 allows further recruitment and activation of the TAK1 (also known as mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 7 (MAP3K7)) complex and I\u00ce\u00baB kinase (IKK) complex. TAK1 and IKK phosphorylate RIPK1 to limit its cytotoxic activity  and activate both nuclear factor kappa\u00e2\u20ac\ufffdlight\u00e2\u20ac\ufffdchain\u00e2\u20ac\ufffdenhancer of activated B cells (NFkappaB) and mitogen\u00e2\u20ac\ufffdactivated protein (MAP) kinase signaling pathways promoting cell survival by induction of anti-apoptotic proteins such as BIRC, cellular FLICE (FADD-like IL-1\u00ce\u00b2-converting enzyme)-like inhibitory protein (cFLIP) and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF and IL-6). When the survival pathway is inhibited, the TRADD:TRAF2:RIPK1 detaches from the membrane-bound TNFR1 signaling complex and recruits Fas-associated death domain-containing protein (FADD) and procaspase-8 (also known as complex II). Once recruited to FADD, multiple procaspase-8 molecules interact via their tandem death-effector domains( DED), thereby facilitating both proximity-induced dimerization and proteolytic cleavage of procaspase-8, which are required for initiation of apoptotic cell death (Hughes MA et al. 2009; Oberst A et al. 2010). When caspase activity is inhibited under certain pathophysiological conditions (e.g. caspase-8 inhibitory proteins such as CrmA and vICA after infection with cowpox virus or CMV) or by pharmacological agents, deubiquitinated RIPK1 is physically and functionally engaged by its homolog RIPK3 leading to formation of the necrosome, a necroptosis-inducing complex consisting of RIPK1 and RIPK3 (Tewari M & Dixit VM 1995; Fliss PM & Brune W 2012; Sawai H 2013; Moquin DM et al. 2013; Kalai M et al. 2002; Cho YS et al. 2009, He S et al. 2009, Zhang DW et al., 2009). Within the complex II procaspase-8 can also form heterodimers with cFLIP isoforms, FLIP long (L) and FLIP short (S), which are encoded by the NFkappaB target gene CFLAR (Irmler M et al. 1997; Boatright KM et al. 2004; Yu JW et al. 2009; Pop C et al. 2011). FLIP(S) appears to act purely as an antagonist of caspase-8 activity blocking apoptotic but promoting necroptotic cell death (Feoktistova  et al. 2011). The regulatory function of FLIP(L) has been found to differ depending on its expression levels. FLIP(L) was shown to inhibit death receptor (DR)-mediated apoptosis only when expressed at high levels, while low cell levels of FLIP(L) enhanced DR signaling to apoptosis (Boatright KM et al. 2004; Okano H et al. 2003; Yerbes R et al. 2011; Yu JW et al. 2009; Hughes MA et al. 2016). In addition, caspase-8:FLIP(L) heterodimer activity within the TRADD:TRAF2:RIPK1:FADD:CASP8:FLIP(L) complex allowed cleavage of RIPK1 to cause the dissociation of the TRADD:TRAF2:RIP1:FADD:CASP8, thereby inhibiting RIPK1-mediated necroptosis (Feoktistova  et al. 2011, 2012). TNF-alpha can also activate sphingomyelinase (SMASE, such as SMPD2,3) proteins to catalyze hydrolysis of sphingomyeline into ceramide (Adam D et al.1996; Adam-Klages S et al. 1998; S\u00c3\u00a9gui B et al. 2001). Activation of neutral SMPD2,3 leads to an accumulation of ceramide at the cell surface and has proinflammatory effects. However, TNF can also activate the pro-apoptotic acidic SMASE via caspase-8 mediated activation of caspase-7 which in turn proteolytically cleaves and activates the 72kDa pro-A-SMase form (Edelmann B et al. 2011). Ceramide induces anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic responses. Further, ceramide can be converted by ceramidase into sphingosine, which in turn is phosphorylated by sphingosine kinase into sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P). S1P exerts the opposite biological effects to ceramide by activating cytoprotective signaling to promote cell growth counteracting the apoptotic stimuli (Cuvillier O et al. 1996). Thus, TNF-alpha-induced TNFR1 activation leads to divergent intracellular signaling networks with extensive cross-talk between the pro-apoptotic/necroptotic pathway, and the other NFkappaB, and MAPK pathways providing highly specific cell responses initiated by various types of stimuli. \n View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=75893 Reactome].", "Pathway Ontology": "signaling pathway && tumor necrosis factor mediated signaling pathway", "Summary": "The tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) signaling pathway is a complex process initiated by the expression of TNF-alpha in response to tissue injury or immune responses to pathogenic stimuli.

However, mutations in the RB gene can lead to its inactivation, resulting in uncontrolled cell growth and tumor formation. This is a common occurrence in various types of cancer, including retinoblastoma, osteosarcoma, and certain forms of breast, lung, and bladder cancer.

Extensive research on the phenotype and the recent discovery and cloning of the responsible gene point to a defect as a central biochemical locus which links several signal transduction pathways that operate under stress as well as in normal physiological conditions.\n\nAtaxia is the first symptom in all patients and is predominantly truncal, first manifested in swaying of the head and trunk on standing and even sitting. Truncal ataxia precedes appendicular cerebellar disease. In the first years of life, certain manifestations are present such as dysarthria, muscular hypotonia, the slow initiation and performance of all voluntary movements, characteristic hypotonic facies and postures, and drooling. Dyssynergia and intention tremor of the upper extremities become a major feature after the fifth year of life. The tendon reflexes are diminished or lost, but may be normal or even hyperactive in the early stages. All these observations show a clear ataxia of cerebellar type, initially of station and gait, and later of intention. Early observations of brains from patients with A-T showed neurodegenerative changes, particularly in the Purkinje and granular cells of the cerebellum. Neuronal degeneration is also present in the brainstem, and dentate and olivary nuclei atrophy. Neuronal loss occurs in the substantial nigra and oculomotor nuclei, dorsal root ganglia, and degenerative changes are evident in spinal motor neurons, and dorsal root and sympathetic motor neurons. Moreover, multiple abnormalities in Purkinje cell development have been observed in an Atm-deficient mouse model. Misplaced Purkinje cells have been observed in both the granular and molecular cell layers. In addition, Purkinje cell dendrites tend to grow laterally instead of extending towards the surface of the cerebellum.\n\nATM (for Ataxia-telangiectasia mutated) has been located by restriction-fragment length polymorphism in the chromosome 11, location: 108,093,211-108,239,829. Interestingly, the site of ATM is the same or adjacent to the region occupied by CD3 (Antigen, Delta subunit), THY1 (T-Cell antigen), and NCAM (Cell Adhesion Molecule, Neural, 1) genes, all of which are members of the immunoglobulin-gene superfamily and consequently may be subject to the same defect that afflicts the T-cell receptor and immunoglobulin molecules in A-T. The ATM gene presents an open reading frame (ORF) of 9,165 kb cDNA and is constituted by 66 exons spread over 150 kb of genomic DNA which has a transcript of 12 kb. The ORF of this transcript predicts a 370-kDa protein composed of 3056 amino acids. Over 300 mutations have been found in A-T patients, distributed across the full length (150 kb of genomic DNA) of the ATM gene.\n\nSequence homology indicates that the atm gene product falls into a family of proteins that are related to the catalytic subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase). This family includes TEL1, MEC1, TOR1, and TOR2 of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, RAD3 of the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, and MEI-41 of Drosophila melanogaster. The mammalian family member most closely related to ATM is the ATR/FRP1 protein and, like its yeast homologs, it mediates cellular responses to unreplicated or damaged DNA. In humans the PI 3-kinase family includes the catalytic subunit of the DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PKcs) and FRAP. These sequence homologies appear to reflect functional homology because many of the PI 3-kinase family members are involved in DNA repair, recombination and cell cycle control. Despite the resemblance to lipid kinases, members of this family, including ATM, possess a serine/threonine protein kinase activity, which is wortmannin sensitive.\n\nATM phosphoprotein is ubiquitously expressed and predominantly found in nuclei of proliferating cells, but subcellular fractionation and immunofluorescence revealed that 10-20% of the protein is present in cytoplasmic vesicles, including peroxisomes and endosomes and a prominent cytoplasmic fraction in mouse oocytes. ATM is endosome-bound in mouse neurons, suggesting molecular sorting of the protein occurs in the cytoplasm. In Purkinje cells, distribution of ATM protein is primarily in cytoplasm, and this may be related to the differentiation state of the cells. ATM mRNA is present in all human and mouse tissues. In situ hybridization shows that ATM mRNA is expressed throughout the whole mouse embryo. Furthermore, ATM has been associated with beta-adaptin in lymphoblast vesicles indicating that it may play a role in intracellular vesicle and/or protein transport mechanisms. No obvious nuclear localization signals have been detected in ATM.

It was also known as lymphopoietin 1and pre-B cell factor. IL-7 plays an important role in the development of B and T cells in mouse and T cells in humans. It is also essential for mature and naive T-cell's survival and proliferation. Human IL-7 gene maps to chromosome 8 and is about 72kb in length. The protein encoded by this gene is 177 amino acids in length with a molecular weight of 20 kDa. The active form of IL-7 in humans is a glycoprotein of 25 kDa. In humans IL-7 has been shown to be produced from intestinal epithelial cells, keratinocytes , hepatic tissues, peripheral blood dendritic cells, follicular dendritic cells, endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts. The IL-7 receptor consists of IL-7 receptor alpha chain (IL-7R\u00ce\u00b1) and a common gamma chain (\u00ce\u00b3c). The gamma chain is also shared by IL-2, IL-4, IL-9, IL-15 and IL-21 receptors. The signaling pathways activated upon IL-7 binding to the receptor complex are JAK-STAT, PI-3 kinase and Src kinase pathways. JAK3, a protein tyrosine kinase is constitutively associated with the carboxy-terminal region of the gamma chain. Studies in mice lacking JAK3 have shown that it is required for transducing \u00ce\u00b3c dependent signals. Mutations in JAK3 and \u00ce\u00b3c have been shown to be associated with the autosomal recessive form of T-B + SCID. JAK1, another protein tyrosine kinase is associated with IL-7R\u00ce\u00b1 chain and is activated upon IL-7 binding. JAK1 deficient mice shows severely impaired thymic development and no hematopoietic colony formation in response to IL-7. IL-7 would first bind to IL-7R\u00ce\u00b1 and then associates with the gamma chain, bringing their intracellular domains bearing JAK1 and JAK3 together. JAK3 phosphorylates IL-7R\u00ce\u00b1 chain creating docking sites for the transcription factors, STAT1, STAT3, and STAT5. JAK1 and JAK3 phosphorylate these STAT molecules and induces their dimerization and translocation to the nucleus where they activate specific target genes. PTK2B, a protein tyrosine kinase has been shown to be associated with JAK1 and plays an important role in the survival of thymocyte cell line. The enzymatic activity and its phosphorylation are highly induced by IL-7. PI-3 kinase pathway is also activated by IL-7 and this pathway is essential for the survival and proliferation of human T cell precursors. PI-3 kinase interacts with IL-7R\u00ce\u00b1 upon IL-7 stimulation and activates its downstream target, AKT and its activation is mediated by \u00ce\u00b3c. AKT in turn activates GSK3 beta and Bad, the death protein. Survival of pro T-cell survival by regulating Bad via PI3 kinase/AKT pathway is mediated by IL-7. IL-7 also mediates the downregulation of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1B through the PI-3 kinase pathway and this effect is required for cell proliferation. IL-7 also induces the phosphorylation of a Src kinase family member, Fyn which is constitutively associated with IL7RA.

IL-4 is primarily involved in promoting the differentiation and proliferation of T helper 2 (TH2) cells and the synthesis of immunoglobulin E (IgE). Apart from its role in allergic responses including asthma, IL-4 was also found to regulate retinal progenitor proliferation, rod photoreceptor differentiation, cholinergic and GABAergic amacrine differentiation and neuroprotection and survival. IL-4 was also found to have regulatory effects in a number of neurological diseases including Alzheimer's disease, Multiple sclerosis, Experimental autoimmune encephelitis. It was also found to relieve inflammatory and neuropathic pain. IL-4 is capable of exerting its biological activities through interaction with two cell surface receptor complexes - Type I IL4 receptor and Type II IL4 Receptor. Both these receptor complexes comprise of a common IL4R\u00ce\u00b1 (CD124) subunit, which is also the functional receptor chain. Type I IL-4 receptor is formed by the interaction of IL4R\u00ce\u00b1 subunit with IL-2\u00ce\u00b3c (CD132). Type II IL-4 receptor is formed by the interaction of IL-4R\u00ce\u00b1 subunit with IL-13R\u00ce\u00b1. Interaction of IL-4 with its receptor results in receptor dimerization and activation.

The breakdown of glycogen, a process known as glycogenolysis, releases glucose in the form of glucose-1-phosphate (G-1-P). The G-1-P is converted to G-6-P by the enzyme phosphoglucomutase. G-6-P is readily fed into glycolysis, (or can go into the pentose phosphate pathway if G-6-P concentration is high) a process that provides ATP to the muscle cells as an energy source. During muscular activity, the store of ATP needs to be constantly replenished. When the supply of oxygen is sufficient, this energy comes from feeding pyruvate, one product of glycolysis, into the Krebs cycle. When oxygen supply is insufficient, typically during intense muscular activity, energy must be released through anaerobic metabolism. Lactic acid fermentation converts pyruvate to lactate by lactate dehydrogenase. Most importantly, fermentation regenerates NAD+, maintaining the NAD+ concentration so that additional glycolysis reactions can occur. The fermentation step oxidizes the NADH produced by glycolysis back to NAD+, transferring two electrons from NADH to reduce pyruvate into lactate. \nInstead of accumulating inside the muscle cells, lactate produced by anaerobic fermentation is taken up by the liver. This initiates the other half of the Cori cycle. In the liver, gluconeogenesis occurs. From an intuitive perspective, gluconeogenesis reverses both glycolysis and fermentation by converting lactate first into pyruvate, and finally back to glucose. The glucose is then supplied to the muscles through the bloodstream; it is ready to be fed into further glycolysis reactions. If muscle activity has stopped, the glucose is used to replenish the supplies of glycogen through glycogenesis.\nOverall, the glycolysis part of the cycle produces 2 ATP molecules at a cost of 6 ATP molecules consumed in the gluconeogenesis part. Each iteration of the cycle must be maintained by a net consumption of 4 ATP molecules. As a result, the cycle cannot be sustained indefinitely. The intensive consumption of ATP molecules indicates that the Cori cycle shifts the metabolic burden from the muscles to the liver.\nSource: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cori_cycle Wikipedia]\n\nProteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP1946 CPTAC Assay Portal]", "Pathway Ontology": "energy metabolic pathway", "Summary": "The Cori cycle, a vital metabolic pathway, enables the body to maintain energy homeostasis during intense muscular activity.

This cycle is essential for maintaining energy balance, particularly during prolonged or intense physical activity. The Cori cycle shifts the metabolic burden from the muscles to the liver, allowing the muscles to conserve energy and maintain function. While the cycle is not sustainable indefinitely due to its energy-intensive nature, it plays a crucial role in maintaining energy homeostasis and supporting muscle function."}, "WAG002139": {"NAME": "RANKL/RANK signaling pathway", "LINK": "https://www.wikipathways.org/index.php/Pathway:WP2018", "WP_ID": "WP2018", "Description": "RANKL (Receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappa B ligand), RANK (Receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappa B) and the natural decoy receptor of RANKL, OPG (Osteoprotegerin) are three important molecules identified to play a major role in osteoclastogenesis and bone remodelling. They are members of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily. OPG was the first molecule to be discovered and proved to inhibit osteoclastogenesis both in vivo and in vitro. Unlike other members of TNF family, OPG lack a transmembrane domain and is secreted as a soluble protein by the cell. RANKL is the only known physiological agonist for its receptor, RANK. Genetic experiments have shown that mice lacking either rankl or rank suffer from severe osteoporosis and defective tooth eruption due to complete lack of osteoclasts. On the contrary, mice deficient of OPG shows osteoporosis due to increased number of osteoclasts. Binding of RANKL to RANK triggers downstream signaling events that leads to the activation of osteoclasts and controlling of lineage commitment. RANKL/RANK signaling is essential for skeletal homoeostasis and its interference leads to inhibition of bone resorption resulting in bone diseases including osteoporosis osteopetrosis and rheumatoid arthritis. RANK being a member of TNF family does not possess any kinase activity. It recruits adaptor molecules to transduce the signal after ligand binding. These adaptor molecules are called TNFR-associated factors or TRAF's that binds to different regions in the cytoplasmic tail of the TNF family receptors and transduces the signal downstream. TRAF6 is the main adaptor molecule which activates NF-\u03baB pathway downstream of RANKL signaling which is required for osteoclastogenesis and osteoclast activation. TRAF6 mutant mice have shown a partial block in osteoclastogenesis and defective activation of mature osteoclasts. Mice lacking NF-\u03baB p50 and p52 proteins have been shown to be osteopetrotic. Catalytic subunits, I\u03baB kinase \u03b1 and I\u03baB kinase \u03b2 and the non-catalytic subunit IKK\u03b3 (also called NEMO) are also essential for RANKL-RANK signaling and osteoclastogenesis. IKK\u03b3 is required for osteoclastogenesis induced by RANKL in mice both in vivo and in vitro whereas IKK\u03b1 was shown to be required in mice only in in vitro. Several mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPK's) have been shown to be activated downstream of RANK. Studies have shown that pharmacological inhibition of p38 MAPK's blocked RANKL induced osteoclast differentiation. JNK1/2, its upstream kinase MKK7 and c-Jun have also been shown by genetic experiments to be essential for RANKL induced osteoclastogenesis. MAPK1 and MAPK3 phosphorylation was also shown to be dispensable for RANKL mediated osteoclast differentiation in vitro, but another report also show that specific inhibitors to MEK increased RANKL induced osteoclastogenesis suggesting a cross talk between p38 and ERK signaling pathways. NFATc1 is an essential downstream target of RANK. Ca2+ oscillations induced by RANKL activated NFATc1 resulting in terminal differentiation of osteoclasts through the Ca2+- dependent calcineurin pathway. NFATc1 translocates to the nucleus where it interacts with other transcription factors leading to the activation of transcription of genes including ACP5, CTSK, TNFRSF11A and NFATc1 under RANKL stimulation. TRAF6 and c-Src interacts with each other and with RANK upon stimulation with RANKL. This interaction increases the kinase activity of c-Src leading to the tyrosine phosphorylation of downstream molecules such as c-Cbl and activation of Akt/PKB which in turn requires the PI3-Kinase activity. Genetic experiments have shown that c-Src is very important in osteoclastogenesis. In addition to these pathways, aPKC/p62 signaling is also reported to be essential for osteoclastogenesis.

The general signaling scheme is rather simple: upon binding of a ligand, an activated plasma membrane receptor complex is formed, which passes on the signal towards the nucleus through a phosphorylated receptor SMAD (R-SMAD). In the nucleus, the activated R-SMAD promotes transcription in complex with a closely related helper molecule termed Co-SMAD (SMAD4). However, this simple linear pathway expands into a network when various regulatory components and mechanisms are taken into account. The signaling pathway includes a great variety of different TGF-beta/BMP superfamily ligands and receptors, several types of the R-SMADs, and functionally critical negative feedback loops. The R-SMAD:Co-SMAD complex can interact with a great number of transcriptional co-activators/co-repressors to regulate positively or negatively effector genes, so that the interpretation of a signal depends on the cell-type and cross talk with other signaling pathways such as Notch, MAPK and Wnt.

Coxon, Anna Villa and Miep H. Helfrich [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23877423].\n\nThe osteopetroses are genetic diseases characterized by increased bone mass and density due to a failure in bone resorption. Two major forms can be distinguished on the basis of their mode of inheritance: autosomal dominant osteopetrosis (ADO, formerly known as Albers-Sch\u00f6nberg disease), is usually considered an adult-onset, more benign form (and has been comprehensively reviewed elsewhere); whereas autosomal recessive osteopetrosis (ARO), also termed malignant infantile osteopetrosis, presents soon after birth, is often severe and leads to death if left untreated.\n\nMechanisms underlying osteoclast-\u2011rich ARO:\nRuffled border formation and bone resorption by osteoclasts are dependent on secretory lysosome trafficking. Genes implicated in osteoclast-\u2011rich autosomal recessive osteopetrosis encode proteins that localize to secretory lysosomes in osteoclasts. TCIRG1 encodes the a3 subunit of the V0 complex, part of the V\u2011ATPase proton pump that acidifies endosomes and lysosomes; CLCN7 encodes ClC\u20117, the Cl\u2013 antiporter responsible for increasing lumenal Cl\u2013 concentration; OSTM1 encodes the \u03b2\u2011subunit of CIC\u20117; PLEKHM1 encodes a cytosolic protein that binds to the active (GTP-\u2011bound) form of Rab7, which is associated with late endosomes and lysosomes; and SNX10 encodes sorting nexin 10, which localizes to endosomes via a phosphoinositide-\u2011binding PX domain. This domain also interacts with the V1 complex D subunit of V\u2011ATPase, raising the possibility that SNX10 is involved in trafficking of V\u2011ATPase. ARO-\u2011causing mutations in all five genes disrupt trafficking of secretory lysosomes, thereby impairing ruffled-\u2011border formation and bone resorption. Osteoclast formation and adhesion to bone through the sealing zone are unaffected.\n\nMechanisms underlying osteoclast-\u2011poor ARO:\nOsteoclastogenesis is dependent on the RANK signalling pathway. In normal osteoclasts, binding of RANKL recruits TRAF6, which releases NF\u03baB from its phosphorylated inhibitor I\u03baB. NF\u03baB translocates to the nucleus and regulates transcription of key osteoclast genes. Osteopetrosis-\u2011causing mutations in TNFRSF11A (which encodes RANK) either reduce protein expression at the plasma membrane  or impair RANKL binding, which leads to the loss of NF\u03baB signalling and prevents differentiation and fusion of osteoclast precursors. Similarly, osteoclast differentiation defects are seen if osteopetrosis-\u2011causing mutations in TNFSF11 (which encodes RANKL) are present. Mutations identified so far lead to reduced RANKL trimerization or impaired RANK binding. Osteoclast formation studies in vitro reveal these two distinct osteoclast-\u2011poor forms of ARO: those in which osteoclastogenesis cannot be induced by synthetic RANKL (TNFRSF11A-\u2011related ARO) and those in which osteoclastogenesis can be induced by synthetic RANKL, resulting in osteoclasts that function normally (TNFSF11-\u2011related ARO). \n\nLinked with a dotted arrow to the GeneProduct nodes are diseases caused by mutation in the respective gene.", "Disease": "autosomal recessive osteopetrosis 2 && autosomal recessive osteopetrosis 7 && autosomal recessive osteopetrosis 5 && autosomal recessive osteopetrosis 6 && autosomal recessive osteopetrosis 3 && autosomal recessive osteopetrosis 8 && autosomal recessive osteopetrosis 1 && autosomal recessive osteopetrosis 4 && familial expansile osteolysis", "Pathway Ontology": "signaling pathway", "Cell Type": "osteoclast", "Summary": "Autosomal recessive osteopetrosis is a genetic disease characterized by increased bone mass and density due to impaired bone resorption.

Mutations in these genes disrupt the formation of ruffled borders and bone resorption in osteoclasts, leading to the accumulation of dense bone. Two forms of autosomal recessive osteopetrosis have been identified: osteoclast-rich and osteoclast-poor. In osteoclast-rich ARO, mutations affect the trafficking of secretory lysosomes, while in osteoclast-poor ARO, mutations impair the RANK signaling pathway, which is essential for osteoclast formation and differentiation. The RANK signaling pathway involves the binding of RANKL to RANK, leading to the activation of NF\u03baB and the regulation of osteoclast gene transcription.

Often through their indirect interactions with coat components, motors, tethering factors and SNAREs, the Rab GTPases serve as multifaceted organizers of almost all membrane trafficking processes in eukaryotic cells. To perform these diverse processes, Rab GTPases interconvert between an active GTP-bound form and an inactive, GDP-bound form. The GTP-bound activated form mediates membrane transport through specific interaction with multiple effector molecules (Zerial & McBride 2001, Stenmark 2009, Zhen & Stenmark 2015, Cherfils & Zeghouf 2013). Conversion from the GTP- to the GDP-bound form occurs through GTP hydrolysis, which is not only driven by the intrinsic GTPase activity of the Rab protein but is also catalysed by GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs). GAPs not only increase the rate of GTP hydrolysis, but they are also involved in the inactivation of RABs, making sure they are inactivated at the correct membrane. Human cells contain as many as 70 Rabs and at least 51 putative Rab GAPs (Pfeffer 2005). Only a few of these GAPs have been matched to a specific Rab substrate. The Tre-2/Bub2/Cdc16 (TBC) domain-containing RAB-specific GAPs (TBC/RABGAPs) are a key family of RAB regulators, where the TBC domain facilitates the inactivation of RABs by facilitating activation of GTPase activity of the RAB (Pan et al. 2006, Frasa et al. 2012, Stenmark 2009).

E2F6 lacks the transactivation domain and acts as a transcriptional repressor (Gaubatz et al. 1998, Trimarchi et al. 1998, Cartwright et al. 1998). E2F6 forms a heterodimer with TFDP1 (DP-1) (Trimarchi et al. 1998, Ogawa et al. 2002, Cartwright et al. 1998) or TFDP2 (DP-2) (Gaubatz et al. 1998, Trimarchi et al. 1998, Cartwright et al. 1998).<p>E2f6 knockout mice are viable and embryonic fibroblasts derived from these mice proliferate normally.

When caspase activity is inhibited under certain pathophysiological conditions or by pharmacological agents, deubiquitinated RIPK1 is engaged in physical and functional interactions with the cognate kinase RIPK3 leading to formation of necrosome, a necroptosis-inducing complex consisting of RIPK1 and RIPK3 (Sawai H 2013; Moquin DM et al. 2013; Kalai M et al. 2002; Cho YS et al. 2009, He S et al. 2009, Zhang DW et al. 2009). Within the necrosome RIPK1 and RIPK3 bind to each other through their RIP homotypic interaction motif (RHIM) domains. The RHIMs can facilitate RIPK1:RIPK3 oligomerization, allowing them to form amyloid-like fibrillar structures (Li J et al. 2012; Mompean M et al. 2018). RIPK3 in turn interacts with mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein (MLKL) (Sun L et al. 2012; Zhao J et al. 2012; Murphy JM et al. 2013; Chen W et al. 2013). The precise mechanism of MLKL activation by RIPK3 is incompletely understood and may vary across species (Davies KA et al. 2020). Mouse MLKL activation relies on transient engagement of RIPK3 to facilitate phosphorylation of the pseudokinase domain (Murphy JM et al. 2013; Petrie EJ et al. 2019a), while it appears that stable recruitment of human MLKL by necrosomal RIPK3 is an additional crucial step in human MLKL activation (Davies KA et al. 2018; Petrie EJ et al. 2018, 2019b). RIPK3-mediated phosphorylation is thought to initiate MLKL oligomerization, membrane translocation and membrane disruption (Sun L et al. 2012; Wang H et al. 2014; Petrie EJ et al. 2020; Samson AL et al. 2020). Studies in human cell lines suggest that upon induction of necroptosis MLKL shifts to the plasma membrane and membranous organelles such as mitochondria, lysosome, endosome and ER (Wang H et al. 2014), but it is trafficking via a Golgi-microtubule-actin-dependent mechanism that facilitates plasma membrane translocation, where membrane disruption causes death (Samson AL et al. 2020). The mechanisms of necroptosis regulation and execution downstream of MLKL remain elusive. The precise oligomeric form of MLKL that mediates plasma membrane disruption has been highly debated (Cai Z et al. 2014; Chen X et al. 2014; Dondelinger Y et al. 2014; Wang H et al. 2014; Petrie EJ et al. 2017, 2018; Samson AL et al. 2020 ). However, microscopy data revealed that MLKL assembles into higher molecular weight species upon cytoplasmic necrosomes within human cells, and upon phosphorylation by RIPK3, MLKL is trafficked to the plasma membrane (Samson AL et al. 2020). At the plasma membrane, phospho-MLKL forms heterogeneous higher order assemblies, which are thought to permeabilize cells, leading to release of DAMPs to invoke inflammatory responses. While RIPK1, RIPK3 and MLKL are the core signaling components in the necroptosis pathway, many additional molecules have been proposed to positively and negatively tune the signaling pathway. Currently, this picture is evolving rapidly as new modulators continue to be discovered.<p>The Reactome module describes MLKL-mediated necroptotic events on the plasma membrane.\n View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=5213460 Reactome].", "Pathway Ontology": "regulatory pathway && cell death pathway && programmed cell death pathway && necrosis pathway", "Summary": "RIPK1-mediated regulated necrosis, also known as necroptosis or programmed necrosis, is a form of cell death that is distinct from apoptosis. It is initiated by the same death ligands that activate extrinsic apoptotic signaling, such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha, Fas ligand, and TRAIL, but is optimally induced when caspases are inhibited. The kinase activities of RIPK1 and RIPK3 are essential for necroptotic cell death, and specific inhibitors of caspase-independent necrosis, necrostatins, have been identified. Necrostatins inhibit the kinase activity of RIPK1, and cell death of apoptotic morphology can be shifted to a necrotic phenotype when caspase 8 activity is compromised.

IL-3 is a 20- 32kDa glycoprotein involved in the process of hematopoiesis. It is involved in the proliferation and differentiation of pleuripotent hematopoietic stem cells, progenitor cells and their mature progeny. IL-3 is a growth factor for B lymphocytes. It also activates monocytes and augments survival and propagation of mast cells, eosinophils and stromal cells. IL-3 is secreted predominantly by activated T lymphocytes in response to immunological stimuli and to a lesser extent by mast cells and eosinophils. IL-3 exerts influence on different biological activities, primarily hematopoiesis by associating with the IL-3 receptor. This receptor is a heterodimeric complex and consists of an alpha chain- IL3RA and a beta chain CSF2RB, shared with the receptors for granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor and Interleukin-5. When IL-3 binds to CSF2RB receptor, adapter proteins like SHC1, GRB2 and SOS1 are recruited to activate HRAS. HRAS stimulates RAF1 which further activates MAP2K1 and finally MAPK1 and MAPK3. The signals generated through this pathway are then transmitted to the nucleus leading to the activation of various transcription factors such as JUN and FOS which are involved in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation. IL-3 mediated activation of HRAS also inhibits apoptosis through phosphatidyl inositol 3 kinase/ AKT pathway. The activation of AKT1 in response to IL-3 stimulation leads to the phosphorylation of the apoptotic regulator, BCL2-associated agonist of cell death (BAD), its binding to 14-3-3 and sequestration into the cytoplasm. IL-3 stimulation activates Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) by its phosphorylation. JAK2 in turn phosphorylates signal transducer and activator of transcription 5A and 5B.

Cell cycle arrest provides cells an opportunity to repair the damage before division, thus preventing the transmission of genetic errors to daughter cells. In addition, it allows cells to attempt a recovery from the damage and survive, preventing premature cell death.<p>TP53 controls transcription of genes involved in both G1 and G2 cell cycle arrest. The most prominent TP53 target involved in G1 arrest is the inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases CDKN1A (p21). CDKN1A is one of the earliest genes induced by TP53 (El-Deiry et al. 1993). CDKN1A binds and inactivates CDK2 in complex with cyclin A (CCNA) or E (CCNE), thus preventing G1/S transition (Harper et al. 1993). Nevertheless, under prolonged stress, the cell destiny may be diverted towards an apoptotic outcome. For instance, in case of an irreversible damage, TP53 can induce transcription of an RNA binding protein PCBP4, which can bind and destabilize CDKN1A mRNA, thus alleviating G1 arrest and directing the affected cell towards G2 arrest and, possibly, apoptosis (Zhu and Chen 2000, Scoumanne et al. 2011). Expression of E2F7 is directly induced by TP53. E2F7 contributes to G1 cell cycle arrest by repressing transcription of E2F1, a transcription factor that promotes expression of many genes needed for G1/S transition (Aksoy et al. 2012, Carvajal et al. 2012). ARID3A is a direct transcriptional target of TP53 (Ma et al. 2003) that may promote G1 arrest by cooperating with TP53 in induction of CDKN1A transcription (Lestari et al. 2012). However, ARID3A may also promote G1/S transition by stimulating transcriptional activity of E2F1 (Suzuki et al. 1998, Peeper et al. 2002).<p>TP53 contributes to the establishment of G2 arrest by inducing transcription of GADD45A and SFN, and by inhibiting transcription of CDC25C. TP53 induces GADD45A transcription in cooperation with chromatin modifying enzymes EP300, PRMT1 and CARM1 (An et al. 2004). GADD45A binds Aurora kinase A (AURKA), inhibiting its catalytic activity and preventing AURKA-mediated G2/M transition (Shao et al. 2006, Sanchez et al. 2010). GADD45A also forms a complex with PCNA. PCNA is involved in both normal and repair DNA synthesis. The effect of GADD45 interaction with PCNA, if any, on S phase progression, G2 arrest and DNA repair is not known (Smith et al. 1994, Hall et al. 1995, Sanchez et al. 2010, Kim et al. 2013). SFN (14-3-3-sigma) is induced by TP53 (Hermeking et al. 1997) and contributes to G2 arrest by binding to the complex of CDK1 and CCNB1 (cyclin B1) and preventing its translocation to the nucleus. Phosphorylation of a number of nuclear proteins by the complex of CDK1 and CCNB1 is needed for G2/M transition (Chan et al. 1999). While promoting G2 arrest, SFN can simultaneously inhibit apoptosis by binding to BAX and preventing its translocation to mitochondria, a step involved in cytochrome C release (Samuel et al. 2001). TP53 binds the promoter of the CDC25C gene in cooperation with the transcriptional repressor E2F4 and represses CDC25C transcription, thus maintaining G2 arrest (St Clair et al. 2004, Benson et al. 2014).<p>Several direct transcriptional targets of TP53 are involved in cell cycle arrest but their mechanism of action is still unknown. BTG2 is induced by TP53, leading to cessation of cellular proliferation (Rouault et al. 1996, Duriez et al. 2002). BTG2 binds to the CCR4-NOT complex and promotes mRNA deadenylation activity of this complex. Interaction between BTG2 and CCR4-NOT is needed for the antiproliferative activity of BTG2, but the underlying mechanism has not been elucidated (Rouault et al. 1998, Mauxion et al. 2008, Horiuchi et al. 2009, Doidge et al. 2012, Ezzeddine et al. 2012). Two polo-like kinases, PLK2 and PLK3, are direct transcriptional targets of TP53. TP53-mediated induction of PLK2 may be important for prevention of mitotic catastrophe after spindle damage (Burns et al. 2003). PLK2 is involved in the regulation of centrosome duplication through phosphorylation of centrosome-related proteins CENPJ (Chang et al. 2010) and NPM1 (Krause and Hoffmann 2010). PLK2 is frequently transcriptionally silenced through promoter methylation in B-cell malignancies (Syed et al. 2006). Induction of PLK3 transcription by TP53 (Jen and Cheung 2005) may be important for coordination of M phase events through PLK3-mediated nuclear accumulation of CDC25C (Bahassi et al. 2004). RGCC is induced by TP53 and implicated in cell cycle regulation, possibly through its association with PLK1 (Saigusa et al. 2007). PLAGL1 (ZAC1) is a zinc finger protein directly transcriptionally induced by TP53 (Rozenfeld-Granot et al. 2002). PLAGL1 expression is frequently lost in cancer (Varrault et al. 1998) and PLAGL1 has been implicated in both cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (Spengler et al. 1997), but its mechanism of action remains unknown.<p>The zinc finger transcription factor ZNF385A (HZF) is a direct transcriptional target of TP53 that can form a complex with TP53 and facilitate TP53-mediated induction of CDKN1A and SFN (14-3-3 sigma) transcription (Das et al. 2007).<p>For a review of the role of TP53 in cell cycle arrest and cell cycle transcriptional targets of TP53, please refer to Riley et al. 2008, Murray-Zmijewski et al. 2008, Bieging et al. 2014, Kruiswijk et al. 2015.\n View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=6791312 Reactome].", "Pathway Ontology": "cell cycle pathway && regulatory pathway", "Summary": "The TP53 protein plays a crucial role in regulating cell cycle progression in response to various stress conditions.

Bacteria in infected individuals, however, are typically confined to the lining of the throat or to a skin lesion; systemic effects are due to the secretion of an exotoxin encoded by a lysogenic bacteriophage. The toxin is encoded as a single polypeptide but is cleaved by host furin-like proteases to yield an aminoterminal fragment A and a carboxyterminal fragment B, linked by a disulfide bond. Toxin cleavage can occur when it first contacts the target cell surface, as annotated here, or as late as the point at which fragment A is released into the cytosol. Fragment B mediates toxin uptake into target cell endocytic vesicles, where acidification promotes a conformational change enabling fragment B to form a channel in the vesicle membrane through which fragment A is extruded into the target cell cytosol. Cleavage of the inter-fragment disulfide bond frees DT fragment A, which catalyzes ADP ribosylation of the translation elongation factor 2 (EEF2) in a target cell, thereby blocking protein synthesis. Neither fragment is toxic to human cells by itself (Collier 1975; Pappenheim 1977; Murphy 2011).\n View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=5336415 Reactome].", "Pathway Ontology": "toxin and toxicant response pathway", "Summary": "Diphtheria toxin is a potent exotoxin secreted by bacteria that causes damage to various tissues and can be fatal if left untreated.

They are remarkably efficient so that very small doses cause paralysis of an affected person (Lalli et al. 2003; Turton et al. 2002). All characterized clostridial neurotoxins are synthesized as products of chromosomal, plasmid  or prophage-borne bacterial genes. The nascent toxin may be cleaved into light (LC) and heavy (HC) chain moieties that remain attached by noncovalent interactions and a disulfide bond (Turton et al. 2002).<p>Strains of Clostridium botulinum produce seven serologically distinct toxins, BoNT/A, B, C, D, E, F, and G. An eighth toxin, BoNT/H has recently been identified (Barash & Arnon 2014) but its molecular properties have not yet been described. Human poisoning most commonly  result from ingestion of toxin contaminated food. More rarely, it is due to wound infection or clostridial colonization of the gut of an infant whose own gut flora have not yet developed or of an older individual whose flora have been suppressed. While all seven characterized toxins can cleave human target proteins, three, BoNT/A, B, and E, are most commonly associated with human disease (Hatheway 1995; Sakaguchi 1982). BoNT/F is also able to cause human botulism.<p>Once ingested, the botulinum toxin must be taken up from the gut lumen into the circulation, a process mediated by four accessory proteins. These proteins form a complex that mediates transcytosis of the toxin molecule across the gut epithelium, allowing its entry into the circulation. The accessory proteins produced by different C. botulinum strains differ in their affinities for polarized epithelia of different species (e.g., human versus canine), and may thus be a key factor in human susceptibility to the toxins of strains A, B, and E and resistance to the others (Simpson 2004).<p>Clostridium tetani produces TeNT toxin. Human poisoning is the result of toxin secretion by bacteria growing in an infected wound and the toxin is released directly into the circulation.<p>Circulating clostridial toxins are taken up by neurons at neuromuscular junctions. They bind to specific gangliosides (BoNT/C, TeNT) or to both gangliosides and synaptic vesicle proteins (BoNT/A, B, D G) exposed on the neuronal plasma membrane during vesicle exocytosis (Montal 2010). All seven characterized forms of BoNT are thought to be taken up into synaptic vesicles as these re-form at the neuromuscular junction. These vesicles remain close to the site of uptake and are rapidly re-loaded with neurotransmitter and acidified (Sudhoff 2004). TeNT, in contrast, is taken up into clathrin coated vesicles that reach the neuron cell body by retrograde transport and then possibly other neurons before undergoing acidification. Vesicle acidification causes a conformational change in the toxin, allowing its HC part to function as a channel through which its LC part is extruded into the neuronal cytosol. The HC - LC disulfide bond is cleaved and the cytosolic LC functions as a zinc metalloprotease to cleave specific bonds in proteins on the cytosolic faces of synaptic vesicles and plasma membranes that normally mediate exocytosis (Lalli et al. 2003; Montal 2010).\n View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=168799 Reactome].", "Disease": "bacterial infectious disease", "Pathway Ontology": "infectious disease pathway && disease pathway", "Summary": "Clostridial neurotoxins, produced by bacteria such as Clostridium botulinum and Clostridium tetani, cause paralysis by blocking synaptic transmission in human neurons.

Depending on SHR type and the presence of ligand, they show different subcellular localizations. Whereas both unliganded and liganded estrogen receptors (ERalpha and ERbeta) are predominantly nuclear, unliganded glucocorticoid (GR) and androgen receptors (AR) are mostly located in the cytoplasm and completely translocate to the nucleus only after binding hormone (Htun H et al. 1999; Stenoien D et al. 2000; Tyagi RK et al. 2000; Cadepond F et al. 1992; Jewell CM et al. 1995; Kumar S et al. 2006). The unliganded mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) is partially cytoplasmic but can be found in nucleus in the ligand-bound or ligand-free form (Nishi M & Kawata M 2007). The progesterone receptor (PR) exists in two forms (PRA and PRB) with different ratios of nuclear versus cytoplasmic localization of the unliganded receptor. In most cell contexts, the PRA isoform is a repressor of the shorter PRB isoform, and without hormone induction it is mostly located in the nucleus, whereas PRB distributes both in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm (Lim CS et al. 1999; Griekspoor A et al. 2007). In the absence of ligand, members of the steroid receptor family remain sequestered in the cytoplasm and/or nucleus in the complex with proteins of HSP70/HSP90 chaperone machinery (Pratt WB & Dittmar KD1998). The highly dynamic ATP-dependent interactions of SHRs with HSP90 complexes regulate SHR cellular location, protein stability, competency to bind steroid hormones and transcriptional activity (Echeverria PC & Picard D 2010). Understanding the mechanism of ATPase activity of HSP90 is mostly based on structural and functional studies of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Hsp90 complexes (Meyer P et al. 2003, 2004; Ali MM et al. 2006; Prodromou C et al. 2000; Prodromou C 2012). The ATPase cycle of human HSP90 is less well understood, however several studies suggest that the underlying enzymatic mechanisms and a set of conformational changes that accompany the ATPase cycle are highly similar in both species (Richter K et al. 2008; Vaughan CK et al. 2009). Nascent SHR proteins are chaperoned by HSP70 and HSP40 to HSP90 cycle via STIP1 (HOP) (and its TPR domains) (Hern\u00c3\u00a1ndez MP et al. 2002a,b; EcheverriaPC & Picard D 2010; Li J et al. 2011). The ATP-bound form of HSP90 leads to the displacement of STIP1 by immunophilins FKBP5 or FKBP4 resulting in conformational changes that allow efficient hormone binding (Li J et al. 2011). PTGES3 (p23) binds to HSP90 complex finally stabilizing it in the conformation with a high hormone binding affinity. After hydrolysis of ATP the hormone bound SHR is released from HSP90 complex. The cytosolic hormone-bound SHR can be transported to the nucleus by several import pathways such as the dynein-based nuclear transport along microtubules involving the transport of the entire HSP90 complex or nuclear localization signals (NLS)-mediated nuclear targeting by importins (Tyagi RK et al. 2000; Cadepond F et al. 1992; Jewell CM et al. 1995; Kumar S et al. 2006). It is worth noting that GR-importin interactions can be ligand-dependent or independent (Freedman & Yamamoto 2004; Picard & Yamamoto 1987). In the nucleus ligand-activated SHR dimerizes, binds specific sequences in the DNA, called Hormone Responsive Elements (HRE), and recruits a number of coregulators that facilitate gene transcription.

The ortholog of VENTX was first described in Xenopus where it participates in BMP and Nanog signaling pathways and controls dorsoventral mesoderm patterning (Onichtchouk et al. 1996, Scerbo et al. 2012). The zebrafish ortholog of VENTX is also involved in dorsoventral patterning in the early embryo (Imai et al. 2001). Rodents lack the VENTX ortholog (Zhong and Holland 2011). VENTX is expressed in human blood cells (Moretti et al. 2001) and appears to play an important role in hematopoiesis. The role of VENTX in hematopoiesis was first suggested based on its role in mesoderm patterning in Xenopus and zebrafish (Davidson and Zon 2000). VENTX promotes cell cycle arrest and differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells and/or progenitor cells (Wu, Gao, Ke, Giese and Zhu 2011, Wu et al. 2014). Ventx suppression leads to expansion of hematopoietic stem cells and multi-progenitor cells (Gao et, J. Biol.Chem, 2012). VENTX induces transcription of cell cycle inhibitors TP53 (p53) and p16INK4A  and activates tumor suppressor pathways regulated by TP53 and p16INK4A (Wu, Gao, Ke, Hager et al. 2011), as well as macrophage colony stimulating factor receptor (CSF1R) (Wu, Gao, Ke, Giese and Zhu 2011) and inhibits transcription of cyclin D1 (CCND1) (Gao et al. 2010) and Interleukin-6 (IL6) (Wu et al. 2014). Chromatin immunoprecipitation showed that EGR3 transcription factor directly binds to the promoter of IL6 and IL8 genes (Baron VT et al, BJC 2015). While VENTX expression may suppress lymphocytic leukemia (Gao et al. 2010), high levels of VENTX have been reported in acute myeloid leukemia cells, with a positive effect on their proliferation (Rawat et al. 2010). Another homeobox transcription factor that regulates differentiation of hematopoietic stemm cells is DLX4 (Bon et al. 2015). Studies on colon cancer showed that VentX regulates tumor associated macrophages and reverts immune suppression in tumor microenvironment (Le et al. 2018). MEK1 is required for Xenopus Ventx2 asymmetric distribution during blastula cell division. Ventx2 inhibition by MEK1 is required for embryonic cell commitment (Scerbo et al, eLife, 2017).

The lengths of collagen fibrils in mature tissues are largely unknown but in tendon can be measured in millimetres (Craig et al. 1989). Collagen fibrils isolated from adult bovine corneal stroma had ~350 collagen molecules in transverse section, tapering down to three molecules at the growing tip (Holmes & Kadler 2005). <br><br>The classical view of collagenases is that they actively unwind the triple helical chain, a process termed molecular tectonics (Overall 2002, Bode & Maskos 2003), before preferentially cleaving the alpha2 chain followed by the remaining chains (Chung et al. 2004). More recently it has been suggested that collagen fibrils exist in an equilibrium between protected and vulnerable states (Stultz 2002, Nerenberg & Stultz 2008). The prototypical triple-helical structure of collagen does not fit into the active site of collagenase MMPs. In addition the scissile bonds are not solvent-exposed and are therefore inaccessible to the collagenase active site (Chung et al. 2004, Stultz 2002). It was realized that collagen must locally unfold into non-triple helical regions to allow collagenolysis. Observations using circular dichroism and differential scanning calorimetry confirm that there is considerable heterogeneity along collagen fibres (Makareeva et al. 2008) allowing access for MMPs at physiological temperatures (Salsas-Escat et al. 2010).<br><br>Collagen fibrils with cut chains are unstable and accessible to proteinases that cannot cleave intact collagen strands (Woessner & Nagase 2000, Somerville et al. 2003).

Degradation of collagen types other than I-III is less well characterized but believed to occur in a similar manner. <br><br>Metalloproteinases (MMPs) play a major part in the degradation of several extracellular macromolecules including collagens. MMP1 (Welgus et al. 1981), MMP8 (Hasty et al. 1987), and MMP13 (Knauper et al. 1996), sometimes referred to as collagenases I, II and III respectively, are able to initiate the intrahelical cleavage of the major fibril forming collagens I, II and III at neutral pH, and thus thought to define the rate-limiting step in normal tissue remodeling events. All can cleave additional  substrates including other collagen subtypes. Collagenases cut collagen alpha chains at a single conserved Gly-Ile/Leu site approximately 3/4 of the molecule's length from the N-terminus (Fields 1991, Chung et al. 2004). The cleavage site is characterised by the motif  G(I/L)(A/L); the G-I/L bond is cleaved. In collagen type I this corresponds to G953-I954 in the Uniprot canonical alpha chain sequences (often given as G775-I776 in literature). It is not clear why only this bond is cleaved, as the motif occurs at several other places in the chain. MMP14, a membrane-associated MMP also known as Membrane-type matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MT-MMP1), is able to cleave collagen types I, II and III (Ohuchi et al. 1997).\n View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=1442490 Reactome].", "Pathway Ontology": "peptide and protein metabolic pathway", "Summary": "Collagen degradation is a complex process influenced by various factors, including species, tissue type, and stage of development.

Recruited cells include polymorhonuclear (PMN) leukocytes (i.e., neutrophils) and monocytes/macrophages, which function together as innate immunity sentinels (Underhill DM & Ozinsky A 2002; Stuart LM & Ezekowitz RA 2005; Flannagan RS et al. 2012). Dendritic cells are also present, serving as important players in antigen presentation for ensuing adaptive responses (Savina A & Amigorena S 2007). These cell types are able to bind and engulf invading microbes into a membrane-enclosed vacuole - the phagosome, in a process termed phagocytosis. Phagocytosis can be defined as the receptor-mediated engulfment of particles greater than 0.5 micron in diameter. It is initiated by the cross-linking of host cell membrane receptors following engagement with their cognate ligands on the target surface (Underhill DM & Ozinsky A 2002; Stuart LM & Ezekowitz RA 2005; Flannagan RS et al. 2012). When engulfed by phagocytes, microorganisms are exposed to a number of host defense microbicidal events within the resulting phagosome. These include the production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS and RNS, RONS) by specialized enzymes (Fang FC et al. 2004; Kohchi C et al. 2009; Gostner JM et al. 2013; Vatansever F et al. 2013). NADPH oxidase (NOX) complex consume oxygen to produce superoxide radical anion (O2.-) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) (Robinson et al. 2004). Induced NO synthase (iNOS) is involved in the production of NO, which is the primary source of all RNS in biological systems (Evans TG et al. 1996). The phagocyte NADPH oxidase and iNOS are expressed in both PMN and mononuclear phagocytes and both cell types have the capacity for phagosomal burst activity. However, the magnitude of ROS generation in neutrophils far exceeds that observed in macrophages (VanderVen BC et al. 2009). Macrophages are thought to produce considerably more RNS than neutrophils (Fang FC et al. 2004; Nathan & Shiloh 2000).<p>The presence of RONS characterized by a relatively low reactivity, such as H2O2, O2\u00cb\u2122\u00e2\u02c6\u2019 or NO, has no deleterious effect on biological environment (Attia SM 2010; Weidinger A & and Kozlov AV 2015). Their activity is controlled by endogenous antioxidants (both enzymatic and non-enzymatic) that are induced by oxidative stress. However the relatively low reactive species can initiate a cascade of reactions to generate more damaging \u00e2\u20ac\u0153secondary\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd species such as hydroxyl radical (\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2OH), singlet oxygen or peroxinitrite (Robinson JM 2008; Fang FC et al. 2004). These \"secondary\" RONS are extremely toxic causing irreversible damage to all classes of biomolecules (Weidinger A & and Kozlov AV 2015; Fang FC et al. 2004; Kohchi C et al. 2009; Gostner JM et al. 2013; Vatansever F et al. 2013).<p>Although macrophages and neutrophils use similar mechanisms for the internalization of targets, there are differences in how they perform phagocytosis and in the final outcome of the process (Tapper H & Grinstein S 1997; Vierira OV et al. 2002). Once formed, the phagosome undergoes an extensive maturation process whereby it develops into a microbicidal organelle able to eliminate the invading pathogen. Maturation involves re-modeling both the membrane of the phagosome and its luminal contents (Vierira OV et al. 2002). In macrophages, phagosome formation and maturation follows a series of strictly coordinated membrane fission/fusion events between the phagosome and compartments of the endo/lysosomal network gradually transforming the nascent phagosome into a phagolysosome, a degradative organelle endowed with potent microbicidal properties (Zimmerli S et al. 1996; Vierira OV et al. 2002). Neutrophils instead contain a large number of preformed granules such as azurophilic and specific granules that can rapidly fuse with phagosomes delivering antimicrobial substances (Karlsson A & Dahlgren C 2002; Naucler C et al. 2002; Nordenfelt P and Tapper H 2011). Phagosomal pH dynamics may also contribute to the maturation process by regulating membrane traffic events. The microbicidal activity of macrophages is characterized by progressive acidification of the lumen (down to pH 4\u00e2\u20ac\u201c5) by the proton pumping vATPase. A low pH is a prerequisite for optimal enzymatic activity of most late endosomal/lysosomal hydrolases reported in macrophages. Neutrophil phagosome pH regulation differs significantly from what is observed in macrophages (Nordenfelt P and Tapper H 2011; Winterbourn CC et al. 2016). The massive activation of the oxidative burst is thought to result in early alkalization of neutrophil phagosomes which is linked to proton consumption during the generation of hydrogen peroxide (Segal AW et al. 1981; Levine AP et al. 2015). Other studies showed that neutrophil phagosome maintained neutral pH values before the pH gradually decreased (Jankowski A et al. 2002). Neutrophil phagosomes also exhibited a high proton leak, which was initiated upon activation of the NADPH oxidase, and this activation counteracted phagosomal acidification (Jankowski A et al. 2002).<p>The Reactome module describes ROS and RNS production by phagocytic cells. The module includes cell-type specific events, for example, myeloperoxidase (MPO)-mediated production of hypochlorous acid in neutrophils. It also highlights differences between phagosomal pH dynamics in neutrophils and macrophages. The module describes microbicidal activity of selective RONS such as hydroxyl radical or peroxynitrite. However, detection of any of these species in the phagosomal environment is subject to many uncertainties (N\u00c3\u00bcsse O 2011; Erard M et al. 2018).

Ub conjugates linked via lysine 48 (K48) target substrates to the proteasome, whereas those linked via any of the six other Ub lysines can alter the function of the modified protein without leading to degradation. Deubiquitination, the reversal of this modification, regulates the function of ubiquitin-conjugated proteins. Deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) catalyze the removal of Ub and regulate Ub-mediated pathways.<br><br>Given that Ub is covalently-linked to proteins destined to be degraded, it is a surprisingly long-lived protein in vivo (Haas & Bright 1987). This is due to the removal of Ub from its conjugates by DUBs prior to proteolysis. This may represent a quality control mechanism that prevents the degradation of proteins that were inappropriately tagged for degradation (Lam et al. 1997).  DUBs are responsible for processing inactive Ub precursors and for keeping the 26S proteasome free of unanchored Ub chains that compete for Ub-binding sites. <br><br>DUBs can be grouped into five families based on their conserved catalytic domains (Amerik & Hochstrasser 2004). Four of these families are thiol proteases and comprise the bulk of DUBs, while the fifth family is a small group of Ub specific metalloproteases. <br><br>Thiol protease DUBs contain a Cys-His-Asp/Asn catalytic triad in which the Asp/Asn functions to polarize and orient the His, while the His serves as a general acid/base by both priming the catalytic Cys for nucleophilic attack on the (iso)peptide carbonyl carbon and by donating a proton to the lysine epsilon-amino leaving group. The nucleophilic attack of the catalytic Cys on the carbonyl carbon produces a negatively charged transition state that is stabilized by an oxyanion hole composed of hydrogen bond donors. A Cys-carbonyl acyl intermediate ensues and is then hydrolyzed by nucleophilic attack of a water molecule to liberate a protein C-terminal carboxylate and regenerate the enzyme. Ub binding often causes structural rearrangements necessary for catalysis. Many DUBs are inactivated by oxidation of the catalytic cysteine to sulphenic acid (single bond SOH) (Cotto-Rios et al. 2012, Lee et al. 2013). This can be reversed by reduction with DTT or glutathione. The sulphenic acid can be irreversibly oxidized to sulphinic acid (single bond SO2H) or sulphonic acid (single bond SO3H). <br> <br>Thiol proteases are reversibly inhibited by Ub C-terminal aldehyde, forming a thio-hemiacetal between the aldehyde group and the active site thiol.\n View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=5688426 Reactome].", "Summary": "Deubiquitination is a crucial regulatory mechanism that reverses the ubiquitination modification, allowing for the regulation of ubiquitin-conjugated proteins.

The pyrimidine ring is synthesized before it is conjugated to PRPP. The first reaction is the conjugation of carbamoyl phosphate and aspartate to make N-carbamoylaspartate. The carbamoyl phosphate synthetase used in pyrimidine biosynthesis is located in the cytoplasm. The enzyme that carries out the reaction is aspartate transcarbamoylase, an enzyme that is closely regulated. The second reaction is ring closure to form dihydroorotic acid by the enzyme dihydroorotase. This circular product contains a 6-membered ring with nitrogen and carbons located in the same positions as in the mature pyrimidine ring. The third reaction is the oxidation of the ring to form a carbon- carbon bond. The reducing equivalents are transferred to a flavin cofactor of the enzyme dihydroorotate dehydrogenase. The product is orotic acid. Fourth, the orotate ring is transferred to phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PRPP) to form a 5-ribose-phosphate, orotidylic acid. Finally orotidylate is decarboxylated to yield UMP, which of course contains one of the bases of RNA. Cellular kinases convert UMP to UTP. Transfer of an amido nitrogen from glutamine by CTP synthetase converts UTP to CTP; this reaction uses an ATP high-energy phosphate. Pyrimidine synthesis is controlled at the first committed step. ATP stimulates the aspartate transcarbamoylase reaction, while CTP inhibits it. CTP is a feedback inhibitor of the pathway, and ATP is a feed-forward activator.

The best characterized target of neddylation is the cullin scaffold subunit of cullin-RING E3 ubiquitin ligases (CRLs), which themselves target numerous cellular proteins for degradation by the proteasome (Hori et al, 1999; reviewed in Soucy et al, 2010; Lyedeard et al, 2013). The multisubunit CRL complexes are compositionally diverse, but each contains a scaffolding cullin protein (CUL1, 2, 3, 4A, 4B, 5, 7 or 9) and a RING box-containing E3 ligase subunit RBX, along with other adaptor and substrate-interacting subunits. RBX2 (also known as RNF7) interacts preferentially with CUL5, while RBX1 is the primary E3 for most other cullin family members (reviewed in Mahon et al, 2014). Neddylation of the cullin subunit increases the ubiquitination activity of the CRL complex (Podust et al, 2000; Read et al, 2000; Wu et al, 2000; Kawakami et al, 2001; Ohh et al, 2002; Yu et al, 2015). In addition to CRL complexes, a number of other less-well characterized NEDD8 targets have been identified. These include other E3 ubiquitin ligases such as SMURF1 and MDM2, receptor tyrosine kinases such as EGFR and TGF beta RII, and proteins that contribute to transcriptional regulation, among others (Xie et al, 2014; Watson et al, 2010; Oved et al, 2006; Zuo et al, 2013; Xirodimas et al, 2004; Singh et al, 2007; Abida et al, 2007; Liu et al 2010; Watson et al, 2006; Loftus et al, 2012; Aoki et al, 2013; reviewed in Enchev et al, 2015). <br>Like ubiquitin, NEDD8 undergoes post-translational processing to generate the mature form. UCHL3- or SENP8-mediated proteolysis removes the C-terminal 5 amino acids of NEDD8, generating a novel C-terminal glycine residue for conjugation to the cysteine residues in the E1, E2 enzymes or lysine residues in the substrate protein, usually the E3 NEDD8 ligase itself (Wada et al, 1998; reviewed in Enchev et al, 2015). Most substrates in vivo appear to be singly neddylated on one or more lysine residues, but NEDD8 chains have been formed on cullin substrates in vitro and on histone H4 in cultured human cells after DNA damage (Jones et al, 2008; Ohki et al, 2009; Xirodimas et al, 2008; Jeram et al, 2010; Ma et al, 2013; reviewed in Enchev et al, 2015).

All NEDD8 E3 enzymes reported to date also function as E3 ubiquitin ligases, and most belong to the RING domain class. The best characterized NEDD8 E3 enzymes are the CRL complexes described above. RBX1-containing complexes interact preferentially with UBE2M, while UBE2F is the E2 for RBX2-containing complexes (Huang et al, 2009; Monda et al, 2013). <br>Neddylation is regulated in vivo by interaction with DCUN1D proteins (also called DCNLs). The 5 human DCUN1D proteins interact both with cullins and with the NEDD8 E2 proteins and thereby increase the kinetic efficiency of neddylation (Kurz et al, 2005; Kurz et al, 2008; Scott et al, 2010; Scott et al, 2011a; Scott et al, 2014; Monda et al, 2013). Glomulin (GLMN) is another regulator of CRL function that binds to the neddylated cullin and competitively inhibits interaction with the ubiquitin E2 enzyme (Arai et al, 2003; Tron et al, 2012; Duda et al, 2012; reviewed in Mahon et al, 2014).<br>The multisubunit COP9 signalosome is the only cullin deneddylase, while SENP8 (also known as DEN1) contributes to deneddylation of other non-cullin NEDD8 targets (Cope et al, 2002; Emberley et al, 2012; Chan et al, 2008; Wu et al, 2003; reviewed in Wei et al, 2008; Enchev et al, 2015). In the deneddylated state, cullins bind to CAND1 (cullin associated NEDD8-dissociated protein1), which displaces the COP9 signalosome and promotes the exchange of the ubiquitin substrate-specific adaptor.

This receptor is involved in regulating cell survival, death, proliferation, and axonogenesis, depending on the cellular context. Notably, p75 NTR can bind to pro-neurotrophins, such as proNGF and proBDNF, which preferentially activate cell death through apoptosis, whereas mature neurotrophins activate TRK receptors to promote survival. The interaction between p75 NTR and TRK signaling pathways is also significant, as it differentially modulates neuronal plasticity, with proBDNF-p75 NTR signaling facilitating long-term depression and BDNF-TRKB signaling promoting long-term potentiation.

Whereas U6 snRNA genes are transcribed by RNA polymerase III, U1,U2, U4, U4atac, U5, U11, and U12 genes are transcribed by RNA polymerase II. Transcription of the U1 and U2 genes has been most extensively studied and the other snRNA genes as well as other genes with similar promoter structures, for example the SNORD13 gene, are inferred to be transcribed by similar reactions. The snRNA genes transcribed by RNA polymerase II are distinguished from mRNA-encoding genes by the presence of a proximal sequence element (PSE) rather than a TATA box and the presence of the Integrator complex rather than the Mediator complex (reviewed in Egloff et al. 2008, Jawdeker and Henry 2008).<br>The snRNA genes are among the most rapidly transcribed genes in the genome. The 5' transcribed region of the U2 snRNA gene is largely single-stranded during interphase and metaphase (Pavelitz et al. 2008) and chromatin within the transcribed region is cleared of nucleosomes (O'Reilly et al. 2014). Transcriptional activation of the RNA polymerase II transcribed snRNA genes begins with binding of transcription factors to the distal sequence element (DSE) of the promoter (reviewed in Hernandez 2001, Egloff et al. 2008, Jawdeker and Henry 2008). The factors, which include POU2F1 (Oct-1), POU2F2 (Oct-2), ZNF143 (Staf) and Sp1, promote binding of the SNAPc complex (also known as PTF and PBP) to the PSE. SNAPc helps clear the gene of nucleosomes (O'Reilly et al. 2014) and recruits initiation factors (TFIIA, TFIIB, TFIIE, TFIIF, and snTAFc:TBP) which recruit RNA polymerase II. Phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II (reviewed in Egloff and Murphy 2008) by CDK7 recruits RPAP2 and the Integrator complex, which is required for later processing of the 3' end of the pre-snRNA transcript (reviewed in Chen and Wagner 2010, Baillat and Wagner 2015). The Little Elongation Complex (LEC) also appears to bind around the time of transcription initiation (Hu et al. 2013). As transcription proceeds, RPAP2 dephosphorylates serine-5 and P-TEFb phosphorylates serine-2 of the CTD. As transcription reaches the end of the snRNA gene serine-7 of the CTD is phosphorylated. These marks serve to bind protein complexes and are required for 3' processing of the pre-snRNA (reviewed in Egloff and Murphy 2008).

In general terms, the first step of initiation is the binding of the replication initiator to the origin of replication. The replicative helicase is then assembled onto the origin, usually by a helicase assembly factor. Either shortly before or shortly after helicase assembly, some local unwinding of the origin of replication occurs in a region rich in adenine and thymine bases (often termed a DNA unwinding element, DUE).

The name \"wnt\" is a fusion of two terms, wg derived from the Drosophila gene wingless (wg) and int derived from the proto-oncogene integration-1, which is the mammalian homolog of wg. \u00c3\u0178-catenin is the key regulated effector of Wnt, involved in canonical signaling . Free \u00c3\u0178-catenin is bound by a multiprotein \"destruction complex\". The \u00c3\u0178-catenin destruction complex is comprised of \u00c3\u0178-catenin, scaffold proteins (APC, AXIN) and serine/threonine kinases that phosphorylate \u00c3\u0178-catenin casein kinase 1 (CSNK1A1, CSNK1D, CSNK1E, CSNK1G1) and GSK3B. The sequential phosphorylation of \u00c3\u0178-catenin by casein kinase 1 and GSK3 is recognised by an SCF-class E3-ubiquitin ligase, which targets it for polyubiquitination and proteosomal destruction. Canonical WNT signals are transduced through a two-part receptor, a seven-transmembrane Frizzled (FZD) and low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5/6 (LRP5/LRP6) to a \u00c3\u0178-catenin (CTNNB1) signaling cascade. On recruitment of deshevelled (DVL1) to FZD and AXIN to LRP6, \u00c3\u0178-catenin destruction complex disassembles leading to its stabilization and nuclear accumulation. Nuclear \u00c3\u0178-catenin binds to T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor (TCF/LEF) family of transcription factors and Legless family docking protein, BCL9. These activate the transcription of Wnt target genes CCND1, MYC. Non-canonical WNT signaling diverges downstream after being transduced through FZD family receptors and co-receptors, ROR2 and RYK. This pathway does not involve \u00c3\u0178-catenin-mediated gene expression. Small G proteins such as RAC1, RHOA and downstream effectors of RAC including JNK are DVL-dependant effector molecules of the non-canonical pathway.

The remainder, including all proteins of the mitochondrial translation system, are encoded in the nucleus and imported from the cytosol into the mitochondrion. Translation in the mitochondrion reflects both the bacterial origin of the organelle and subsequent divergent evolution during symbiosis (reviewed in Huot et al. 2014, Richman et al. 2014). Human mitochondrial ribosomes have a low sedimentation coefficient of only 55S, but at 2.71 MDa they retain a similar mass to E. coli 70S particles. The 55S particles are protein-rich compared to both cytosolic ribosomes and eubacterial ribosomes. This is due to shorter mt-rRNAs, mitochondria-specific proteins, and numerous rearrangements in individual protein positions within the two ribosome subunits (inferred from bovine ribosomes in Sharma et al. 2003, Greber et al. 2014, Kaushal et al. 2014, reviewed in Agrawal and Sharma 2012).<br>Mitochondrial mRNAs have either no untranslated leader or short leaders of 1-3 nucleotides, with the exception of the 2 bicistronic transcripts, RNA7 and RNA14, which have overlapping orfs that encode ND4L/ND4 and ATP8/ATP6 respectively. Translation is believed to initiate with the mRNA binding the 28S subunit:MTIF3 (28S subunit:IF-3Mt, 28S subunit:IF2mt) complex together with MTIF2:GTP (IF-2Mt:GTP, IF2mt:GTP) at the matrix face of the inner membrane (reviewed in Christian and Spremulli 2012). MTIF3 can dissociate 55S particles in preparation for initiation, enhances formation of initiation complexes, and inhibits N-formylmethionine-tRNA (fMet-tRNA) binding to 28S subunits in the absence of mRNA. Binding of fMet-tRNA to the start codon of the mRNA results in a stable complex while absence of a start codon at the 5' end of the mRNA causes eventual dissociation of the mRNA from the 28S subunit. After recognition of a start codon, the 39S subunit then binds the stable complex, GTP is hydrolyzed, and the initiation factors MTIF3 and MTIF2:GDP dissociate.<br>Translation elongation then proceeds by cycles of aminoacyl-tRNAs binding, peptide bond formation, and displacement of deacylated tRNAs. In each cycle an aminoacyl-tRNA in a complex with TUFM:GTP (EF-Tu:GTP) binds at the A-site of the ribosome, GTP is hydrolyzed, and TUFM:GDP dissociates. The elongating polypeptide bonded to the tRNA at the P-site is transferred to the aminoacyl group at the A-site by peptide bond formation at the peptidyl transferase center, leaving a deacylated tRNA at the P-site and the elongating polypeptide attached to the tRNA at the A-site. The polypeptide is co-translationally inserted into the inner mitochondrial membrane via an interaction with OXA1L (Haque et al. 2010, reviewed in Ott and Hermann 2010). After peptide bond formation, GFM1:GTP (EF-Gmt:GTP) then binds the ribosome complex, GTP is hydrolyzed, GFM1:GDP dissociates, and the ribosome translocates 3 nucleotides in the 3' direction along the mRNA, relocating the polypeptide-tRNA to the P-site and allowing another cycle to begin. TUFM:GDP is regenerated to TUFM:GTP by the guanine nucleotide exchange factor TSFM (EF-Ts, EF-TsMt).<br>Translation is terminated when MTRF1L:GTP (MTRF1a:GTP) recognizes an UAA or UAG termination codon at the A-site of the ribosome (Tsuboi et al. 2009). GTP hydrolysis does not appear to be required. The tRNA-aminoacyl bond between the translated polypeptide and the final tRNA at the P-site is hydrolyzed by the 39S subunit, facilitating release of  the polypeptide. MRRF (RRF) and GFM2:GTP (EF-G2mt:GTP) then act to release the remaining tRNA and mRNA from the ribosome and dissociate the 55S ribosome into 28S and 39S subunits.<br>Mutations have been identified in genes encoding mitochondrial ribosomal proteins and translation factors.

Epigenetic repression involves the recruitment of Mi-2/NuRD upon SALL4 binding to the PTEN promoter (Yang et al. 2008, Lu et al. 2009) or EVI1-mediated recruitment of the polycomb repressor complex (PRC) to the PTEN promoter (Song et al. 2009, Yoshimi et al. 2011). Transcriptional regulation is also elicited by negative regulators, including NR2E1:ATN1 (atrophin-1) complex, JUN (c-Jun), SNAIL and SLUG (Zhang et al. 2006, Vasudevan et al. 2007, Escriva et al. 2008, Uygur et al. 2015) and positive regulators such as TP53 (p53), MAF1, ATF2, EGR1 or PPARG (Stambolic et al. 2001, Virolle et al. 2001, Patel et al. 2001, Shen et al. 2006, Li et al. 2016).<p>MicroRNAs miR-26A1, miR-26A2, miR-22, miR-25, miR-302, miR-214, miR-17-5p, miR-19 and miR-205 bind PTEN mRNA and inhibit its translation into protein. These microRNAs are altered in cancer and can account for changes in PTEN levels (Meng et al. 2007, Xiao et al. 2008, Yang et al. 2008, Huse et al. 2009, Kim et al. 2010, Poliseno, Salmena, Riccardi et al. 2010, Cai et al. 2013). In addition, coding and non-coding RNAs can prevent microRNAs from binding to PTEN mRNA. These RNAs are termed competing endogenous RNAs or ceRNAs. Transcripts of the pseudogene PTENP1 and mRNAs transcribed from SERINC1, VAPA and CNOT6L genes exhibit this activity (Poliseno, Salmena, Zhang et al. 2010, Tay et al. 2011, Tay et al. 2014).<p>PTEN can translocate from the cytosol to the nucleus after undergoing monoubiquitination. PTEN's ability to localize to the nucleus contributes to its tumor suppressive role (Trotman et al. 2007). The ubiquitin protease USP7 (HAUSP) targets monoubiquitinated PTEN in the nucleus, resulting in PTEN deubiquitination and nuclear exclusion. PML, via an unknown mechanism that involves USP7- and PML-interacting protein DAXX, inhibits USP7-mediated deubiquitination of PTEN, thus promoting PTEN nuclear localization. Disruption of PML function in acute promyelocytic leukemia, through a chromosomal translocation that results in expression of a fusion protein PML-RARA, leads to aberrant PTEN localization (Song et al. 2008).<p>Several ubiquitin ligases, including NEDD4, WWP2, STUB1 (CHIP), RNF146, XIAP and MKRN1, polyubiquitinate PTEN and target it for proteasome-mediated degradation (Wang et al. 2007, Van Themsche et al. 2009, Ahmed et al. 2011, Maddika et al. 2011, Lee et al. 2015, Li et al. 2015). The ubiquitin proteases USP13 and OTUD3, frequently down-regulated in breast cancer, remove polyubiquitin chains from PTEN, thus preventing its degradation and increasing its half-life (Zhang et al. 2013, Yuan et al. 2015). The catalytic activity of PTEN is negatively regulated by PREX2 binding (Fine et al. 2009, Hodakoski et al. 2014) and TRIM27-mediated ubiquitination (Lee et al. 2013), most likely through altered PTEN conformation.<p>In addition to ubiquitination, PTEN also undergoes SUMOylation (Gonzalez-Santamaria et al. 2012, Da Silva Ferrada et al. 2013, Lang et al. 2015, Leslie et al. 2016). SUMOylation of the C2 domain of PTEN may regulate PTEN association with the plasma membrane (Shenoy et al. 2012) as well as nuclear localization of PTEN (Bassi et al. 2013, Collaud et al. 2016). PIASx-alpha, a splicing isorom of E3 SUMO-protein ligase PIAS2 has been implicated in PTEN SUMOylation (Wang et al. 2014). SUMOylation of PTEN may be regulated by activated AKT (Lin et al. 2016). Reactions describing PTEN SUMOylation will be annotated when mechanistic details become available.<p>Phosphorylation affects the stability and activity of PTEN. FRK tyrosine kinase (RAK) phosphorylates PTEN on tyrosine residue Y336, which increases PTEN half-life by inhibiting NEDD4-mediated polyubiquitination and subsequent degradation of PTEN. FRK-mediated phosphorylation also increases PTEN enzymatic activity (Yim et al. 2009). Casein kinase II (CK2) constitutively phosphorylates the C-terminal tail of PTEN on serine and threonine residues S370, S380, T382, T383 and S385. CK2-mediated phosphorylation increases PTEN protein stability (Torres and Pulido 2001) but results in ~30% reduction in PTEN lipid phosphatase activity (Miller et al. 2002).<p>PTEN localization and activity are affected by acetylation of its lysine residues (Okumura et al. 2006, Ikenoue et al. 2008, Meng et al. 2016). PTEN can undergo oxidation, which affects its function, but the mechanism is poorly understood (Tan et al. 2015, Shen et al. 2015, Verrastro et al. 2016).\n View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=6807070 Reactome].", "Summary": "PTEN regulation is a complex process involving multiple mechanisms to control its expression, localization, and stability.

Most DRFs contain a dimerization domain (DD) and a coiled-coil region (CC) in between FH3 and FH1 domains (reviewed by Kuhn and Geyer 2014). RHO GTPase-activated DRFs are autoinhibited through the interaction between FH3 and DAD which is disrupted upon binding to an active RHO GTPase (Li and Higgs 2003, Lammers et al. 2005, Nezami et al. 2006). Since formins dimerize, it is not clear whether the FH3-DAD interaction is intra- or intermolecular. FH2 domain is responsible for binding to the F-actin and contributes to the formation of head-to-tail formin dimers (Xu et al. 2004). The proline-rich FH1 domain interacts with the actin-binding proteins profilins, thereby facilitating actin recruitment to formins and accelerating actin polymerization (Romero et al. 2004, Kovar et al. 2006).<p>Different formins are activated by different RHO GTPases in different cell contexts. FMNL1 (formin-like protein 1) is activated by binding to the RAC1:GTP and is involved in the formation of lamellipodia in macrophages (Yayoshi-Yamamoto et al. 2000) and is involved in the regulation of the Golgi complex structure (Colon-Franco et al. 2011).

Activation of FMNL2 (formin-like protein 2) and FMNL3 (formin-like protein 3) by RHOC:GTP is involved in cancer cell motility and invasiveness (Kitzing et al. 2010, Vega et al. 2011). DIAPH1, activated by RHOA:GTP, promotes elongation of actin filaments and activation of SRF-mediated transcription which is inhibited by unpolymerized actin (Miralles et al. 2003). RHOF-mediated activation of DIAPH1 is implicated in formation of stress fibers (Fan et al. 2010). Activation of DIAPH1 and DIAPH3 by RHOB:GTP leads to actin coat formation around endosomes and regulates endosome motility and trafficking (Fernandez-Borja et al. 2005, Wallar et al. 2007). Endosome trafficking is also regulated by DIAPH2 transcription isoform 3 (DIAPH2-3) which, upon activation by RHOD:GTP, recruits SRC kinase to endosomes (Tominaga et al. 2000, Gasman et al. 2003).

Similar to RUNX1 and RUNX2, RUNX3 forms a transcriptionally active heterodimer with CBFB (CBF-beta).

RUNX3 is implicated as a tumor suppressor gene in various human malignancies.<br>During nervous system formation, the Cbfb:Runx3 complex is involved in development of mouse proprioceptive dorsal root ganglion neurons by regulating expression of Ntrk3 (Neurotrophic tyrosine kinase receptor type 3) and possibly other genes (Inoue et al. 2002, Kramer et al. 2006, Nakamura et al. 2008, Dykes et al. 2011, Ogihara et al. 2016). It is not yet known whether RUNX3 is involved in human neuronal development and neuronal disorders.<br>RUNX3 plays a major role in immune response. RUNX3 regulates development of T lymphocytes. In mouse hematopoietic stem cells, expression of Runx3 is regulated by the transcription factor TAL1 (Landry et al. 2008). RUNX3 promotes the CD8+ lineage fate in developing thymocytes. In the CD4+ thymocyte lineage in mice, the transcription factor ThPOK induces transcription of SOCS family members, which repress Runx3 expression (Luckey et al. 2014). RUNX3, along with RUNX1 and ETS1, is implicated in regulation of transcription of the CD6 gene, encoding a lymphocyte surface receptor expressed on developing and mature T cells (Arman et al. 2009). RUNX3 and ThPOK regulate intestinal CD4+ T cell immunity in a TGF-beta and retinoic acid-dependent manner, which is important for cellular defense against intestinal pathogens (Reis et al. 2013). Besides T lymphocytes, RUNX3 is a key transcription factor in the commitment of innate lymphoid cells ILC1 and ILC3 (Ebihara et al. 2015). RUNX3 regulates expression of CD11A and CD49D integrin genes, involved in immune and inflammatory responses (Dominguez-Soto et al. 2005). RUNX3 is involved in mouse TGF-beta-mediated dendritic cell function and its deficiency is linked to airway inflammation (Fainaru et al. 2004).<br>In addition to its developmental role, RUNX3 is implicated as a tumor suppressor. The loss of RUNX3 expression and function was first causally linked to the genesis and progression of human gastric cancer (Li et al. 2002). Expression of RUNX3 increases in human pancreatic islet of Langerhans cells but not in pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells in response to differentiation stimulus (serum withdrawal) (Levkovitz et al. 2010). Hypermethylation of the RUNX3 gene is associated with an increased risk for progression of Barrett's esophagus to esophageal adenocarcinoma (Schulmann et al. 2005). Hypermethylation-mediated silencing of the RUNX3 gene expression is also frequent in granulosa cell tumors (Dhillon et al. 2004) and has also been reported in colon cancer (Weisenberger et al. 2006), breast cancer (Lau et al. 2006, Huang et al. 2012), bladder cancer (Wolff et al. 2008) and gastric cancer (Li et al. 2002).

It has additional roles in embryonic development, removal of apoptotic cells or organelles, antigen presentation, protection against toxins and as a degradation route for aggregate-prone proteins and infectious agents. The dysregulation of autophagy is involved in several human diseases, for example, Crohn's disease, cancer and neurodegeneration (Ravikumar et al. 2010).<br>Autophagy is highly conserved from yeast to humans; much of the machinery was first identified in yeast (see Klionsky et al. 2011). Initially, double-membraned cup-shaped structures called the isolation membrane or phagophore engulf portions of cytoplasm. The membranes fuse to form the autophagosome. In yeast cells, autophagosomes are formed at the phagophore assembly site (PAS) next to the vacuole. In mammals, autophagosomes appear throughout the cytoplasm then move along microtubules towards the microtubule-organising centre. This transport requires microtubules and the function of dynein motor proteins; depolymerization of microtubules or inhibition of dynein-dependent transport results in inhibition of autophagy (Kochl et al. 2006, Kimura et al. 2008). Autophagosomes fuse with lysosomes forming autolysosomes whose contents are degraded by lysosomal hydrolases (Mizushima et al. 2011).<br><br>The origins of the autophagosomal membrane and the  incorporation of existing membrane material have been extensively debated. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER), mitochondria, mitochondria-associated ER membranes (MAMs), the Golgi, the plasma membrane and recycling endosomes have all been implicated in the nucleation of the isolation membrane and subsequent growth of the membrane (Lamb et al. 2013). Recently 3D tomographic imaging of isolation membranes has shown the cup-shaped isolation membrane tightly sandwiched between two sheets of ER and physically connected to the ER through a narrow membrane tube (Hayashi-Nishino et al. 2009, Yla-Anttila et al. 2009). This suggests that isolation membrane formation and elongation are guided by adjacent ER sheets, supporting the now prevalent 'ER cradle' model, which suggests that the isolation membrane arises from the ER (Hayashi-Nishino et al. 2009, Shibutani & Yoshimori 2014).<br><br>Autophagy is tightly regulated. The induction of autophagy in response to starvation is partly mediated by inactivation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) (Noda & Ohsumi 1998) and activation of Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), while energy loss induces autophagy by activation of AMP kinase (AMPK). Other pathways regulating autophagy are regulated by calcium, cyclic AMP, calpains and the inositol trisphosphate (IP3) receptor (Rubinsztein et al. 2012). <br><br>In mammals, two complexes cooperatively produce the isolation membrane. The ULK complex consists of ULK1/2, ATG13, (FIP200) and ATG101 (Alers et al. 2012). The PIK3C3-containing Beclin-1 complex consists of PIK3C3 (Vps34), BECN1 (Beclin-1, Atg6), PIK3R4 (p150, Vps15) and ATG14 (Barkor) (Matsunaga et al. 2009, Zhong et al. 2009). A similar complex where ATG14 is replaced by UVRAG functions later in autophagosome maturation and endocytic traffic (Itakura et al. 2008, Liang et al. 2008). Binding of KIAA0226 to this complex negatively regulates the maturation process (Matsunaga et al. 2009). The ULK and Beclin-1 complexes are recruited to specific autophagosome nucleation regions where they stimulate phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PI3P) production and facilitate the elongation and initial membrane curvature of the phagophore membrane (Carlsson & Simonsen 2015).<br><br>The ULK complex is considered the most upstream component of the mammalian autophagy pathway (Itakura & Mizushima 2010), acting as an integrator of the autophagy signals downstream of mTORC1. It is not fully understood how ULK1 is modulated in response to environmental cues. Phosphorylation plays an essential role (Dunlop & Tee 2013) but it is not clear how phosphorylation regulates ULK1 activities (Ravikumar et al. 2010). ULK1 kinase activity is required for autophagy, but the substrate(s) of ULK1 that mediate its autophagic function are not certain. ULK1 may also have kinase-independent functions in autophagy (Wong et al. 2013). <br><br> PIK3C3 (Vps34) is a class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase that produces PI3P. It is essential for the early stages of autophagy and colocalizes strongly with early autophagosome markers (Axe et al. 2008). BECN1 binds several further proteins that affect autophagosome formation. Partners that induce autophagy include AMBRA1 (Fimia et al. 2007), UVRAG (Liang et al. 2006) and SH3GLB1 (Takahashi et al. 2007). Binding of BCL2 or BCL2L1 (Bcl-xL) inhibit autophagy (Pattingre et al. 2005, Ciechomska et al. 2009). The inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor complex that binds BCL2 also interacts with BECN1, inhibiting autophagy (Vincencio et al. 2009). CISD2 (Nutrient-deprivation autophagy factor-1, NAF1), a component in the IP3R complex, interacts with BCL2 at the ER and stabilizes the BCL2-BECN1 interaction (Chang et al. 2010). Starvation leads to activation of c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase-1 (JNK1), which results in the phosphorylation of BCL2 and BCL2L1, which release their binding to BECN1 and thus induces autophagosome formation (Wei et al. 2008). <br><br>AMBRA1 can simultaneously bind dynein and the Beclin-1 complex.  During nutrient starvation, AMBRA1 is phosphorylated in a ULK1-dependent manner (Di Bartolomeo et al. 2010). This phosphorylation releases AMBRA1-associated Beclin-1 complexes from dynein and the microtubule network, freeing the complex to translocate to autophagy initiation sites (Di Bartolomeo et al. 2010). <br><br>A characteristic of this early phase of autophagosome formation is the formation of PI3P-enriched ER-associated structures called omegasomes (Axe et al. 2008) or cradles (Hayashi-Nishino et al. 2009). Omegasomes appear to concentrate at or near the connected mitochondria-associated ER membrane (Hamasaki et al. 2013). However, the phagophore also can incorporate existing material from other membrane sources such as ER exit sites (ERES), the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC), the Golgi, the plasma membrane and recycling endosomes (Carlsson & Simonsen 2015). Omegasomes lead to the formation of the isolation membrane or phagophore, which is thought to form de novo by an unknown mechanism (Simonsen & Stenmark 2008, Roberts & Ktistakis 2013). Phagophore expansion is probably mediated by membrane uptake from endomembranes and semi-autonomous organelles (Lamb et al. 2013, Shibutani & Yoshimori 2014).<br><br>ATG9 is a direct target of ULK1. In nutrient-rich conditions mammalian ATG9 is localized to the trans-Golgi network and endosomes (including early, late and recycling endosomes), whereas under starvation conditions it is localized to autophagosomes, in a process that is dependent on ULK1 (Young et al. 2006). ATG9 is believed to play a role in the delivery of vesicles derived from existing membranes to the expanding phagophore (Lamb et al. 2013). Yeast Atg9 forms a complex with Atg2 and Atg18 (Reggiori et al. 2004). <br><br>PI3P produced at the initiation site is sensed by WIPI2b, the mammalian homologue of Atg18 (Polson et al. 2010). WIPI2b then recruits Atg16L1 (Dooley et al. 2014). There are four WIPI proteins in mammalian cells (Proikas-Cezanne et al. 2015). They are all likely bind PI3P and be recruited to membranes but the function of WIPI1, 3 and 4 in autophagy is not yet clear. WIPI4 (WDR45) has been shown to bind Atg2 and to be involved in lipid droplet formation (Velikkakath et al. 2012); mutations in WIPI4 have been shown to cause a neurodegenerative disease (Saitsu et al. 2013).<br><br>The elongation of the membrane that will become the autophagosome is regulated by two ubiquitination-like reactions. First, the ubiquitin-like molecule ATG12 is conjugated to ATG5 by ATG7, which acts as an E1-like activating enzyme, and ATG10, which has a role similar to an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme. The ATG5:ATG12 complex then interacts non-covalently with ATG16L1. This complex associates with the forming autophagosome but dissociates from completed autophagosomes (Geng & Klionski 2008). The second ubiquitin-like reaction involves the conjugation of ubiquitin-like molecules of the LC3 family (Weidberg et al. 2010). LC3 proteins are conjugated through their C-terminal glycine residues with PE by the E1-like ATG7 and E2-like ATG3. This allows LC3 proteins to associate with the autophagosome membrane. <br><br>The ATG12:ATG5:ATG16L1 complex (Mizushima et al., 2011) acts as an E3 like enzyme for the conjugation of LC3 family proteins (mammalian homologues of yeast Atg8) to phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) (Hanada et al. 2007, Fujita et al. 2008). LC3 PE can be deconjugated by the protease ATG4 (Li et al. 2011, 2012). ATG4 is also responsible for priming LC3 proteins by cleaving the C terminus to expose a glycine residue (Kirisako et al, 2000, Scherz Shouval et al. 2007). LC3 proteins remain associated with autophagosomes until they fuse with lysosomes. The LC3-like proteins inside the resulting autolysosomes are degraded, while those on the cytoplasmic surface are delipidated and recycled. ATG5:ATG12:ATG16L1-positive LC3-negative vesicles represent pre-autophagosomal structures (pre-phagophores and possibly early phagophores), ATG5:ATG12:ATG16L1-positive LC3-positive structures can be considered to be phagophores, and ATG5:ATG12:ATG16L1-negative LC3-positive vesicles can be regarded as mature autophagosomes (Tandia et al. 2011).<br><br>Phagophore expansion is probably mediated by membrane uptake from endomembranes as well as from semiautonomous organelles (Lamb et al. 2013, Shibutani & Yoshimori 2014).<br><br>The mechanisms involved in the closure of the phagophore membrane are poorly understood. As the phagophore is a double-membraned structure, its closure involves the fusion of a narrow opening, a process that is distinct from other membrane fusion events (Carlsson & Simonsen 2015). The topology of the phagophore is similar to that of cytokinesis, viral budding or multivesicular body (MVB) formation. These processes rely on the Endosomal Sorting Complex Required for Transport (ESCRT) (Rusten et al. 2012). ESCRT and associated proteins facilitate membrane budding away from the cytosol and subsequent cleavage of the bud neck (Hurley & Hanson 2010). Several studies have shown that depletion of ESCRT subunits or the regulatory ATPase Vps4 causes an accumulation of autophagosomes (Filimonenko et al. 2007, Rusten et al. 2007) but it is not clear whether ESCRTs are required for autophagosome closure or for autophagosome to endosome fusion. UVRAG is also involved in the maturation step, recruiting proteins that bring about membrane fusion such as the class C Vps proteins, which activate Rab7 thereby promoting fusion with late endosomes and lysosomes (Liang et al. 2008).\n View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=1632852 Reactome].", "Pathway Ontology": "regulatory pathway", "Summary": "Autophagy acts as a buffer against starvation by liberating building materials and energy sources from cellular components. It has additional roles in embryonic development, removal of apoptotic cells or organelles, antigen presentation, protection against toxins, and as a degradation route for aggregate-prone proteins and infectious agents. The dysregulation of autophagy is involved in several human diseases, including Crohn's disease, cancer, and neurodegeneration. Autophagy is highly conserved from yeast to humans, with much of the machinery first identified in yeast. The process involves the formation of double-membraned cup-shaped structures called autophagosomes, which engulf portions of cytoplasm and fuse with lysosomes to form autolysosomes whose contents are degraded by lysosomal hydrolases. The origins of the autophagosomal membrane and the incorporation of existing membrane material have been extensively debated, with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria-associated ER membranes (MAMs) implicated in the nucleation of the isolation membrane and subsequent growth of the membrane. Autophagy is tightly regulated, with the induction of autophagy in response to starvation partly mediated by inactivation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and activation of Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). The ULK complex and the Beclin-1 complex are key regulators of autophagy, with the ULK complex acting as an integrator of autophagy signals downstream of mTORC1. The elongation of the membrane that will become the autophagosome is regulated by two ubiquitination-like reactions, involving the conjugation of ATG12 to ATG5 and the conjugation of LC3 family proteins to phosphatidylethanolamine (PE).

Core protein synthesis occurs in the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER). Once PG core protein has been synthesized, it moves from the RER to the Golgi apparatus where the first sugar of glycosaminoalycan (GAG) chain is added on Ser residues. GAG synthesis continues by glycosyltransferases that transfer sugar moieties from UDP-sugars to GAG chains. UDP-sugars are synthesized in the cytoplasm and are translocated in the Golgi apparatus by an antiporter with UMP. Then UDP, the by-product of glycosyltransferase reactions, is hydrolyzed to UMP and phosphate by calcium activated nucleotidase 1 (CANT1). Chondroitin, dermatan and heparan sulfate synthesis starts on a Ser residue of the PG core protein with the formation of a tetrasaccharide linkage region composed of a xylose (Xyl), two galactoses (Gal) and a glucuronic acid (GlcUA). After tetrasaccharide synthesis, GAG chain elongation continues through the binding of specific saccharides defining chondroitin sulfate, dermatan sulfate and heparan sulfate. Specific enzymes are involved in this process and mutations in their gene cause different types of skeletal dysplasia (indicated in red boxes). The third step is GAG sulfation.  Sulfate enters in cells through the SLC26A2 transporter and it is activated to 30-phosphoadenosine 50-phosphosulfate (PAPS) by PAPS synthase (PAPSS) in the cytosol. Through a PAPS transporter (PAPST), PAPS moves to Golgi apparatus where it is used as sulfate donor by sulfotransferases to sulfate GAGs. This reaction also produces phosphoadenosine phosphate (PAP), that is hydrolyzed into AMP and phosphate by a Golgi resident phosphoadenosine phosphate phosphatase (gPAPP). Once synthesized, PGs are secreted in extracellular space.\n\nSulfation of GAGs is an important step in PG synthesis determining PG properties. Inorganic sulfate enters in cells through a sulfate/chloride antiporter named SLC26A2, but a small amount of sulfate could be derived from sulfur-containing amino acid metabolism. To be used by Golgi sulfotransferases, sulfate is activated to 30-phosphoadenosine 50-phosphosulfate (PAPS), the universal sulfate donor, by PAPS synthase (PAPSS2).

They also play important roles in inflammatory and immediate allergic reactions. Activation through FCERI-bound antigen-specific IgE causes release of potent inflammatory mediators, such as histamine, proteases, chemotactic factors, cytokines and metabolites of arachidonic acid that act on the vasculature, smooth muscle, connective tissue, mucous glands and inflammatory cells (Borish & Joseph 1992, Amin 2012, Metcalfe et al. 1993). FCERI is a multimeric cell-surface receptor that binds the Fc fragment of IgE with high affinity. On mast cells and basophils FCERI exists as a tetrameric complex consisting of one alpha-chain, one beta-chain, and two disulfide-bonded gamma-chains, and on dendritic cells, Langerhans cells, macrophages, and eosinophils it exists as a trimeric complex with one alpha-chain and two disulfide-bonded gamma-chains (Wu 2011, Kraft & Kinet 2007). FCERI signaling in mast cells includes a network of signaling molecules and adaptor proteins. These molecules coordinate ultimately leading to effects on degranulation, eicosanoid production, and cytokine and chemokine production and cell migration and adhesion, growth and survival.<br>The first step in FCERI signaling is the phosphorylation of the tyrosine residues in the ITAM of both the beta and the gamma subunits of the FCERI by LYN, which is bound to the FCERI beta-chain. The phosphorylated ITAM then recruits the protein tyrosine kinase SYK (spleen tyrosine kinase) which then phosphorylates the adaptor protein LAT. Phosphorylated LAT (linker for activation of T cells) acts as a scaffolding protein and recruits other cytosolic adaptor molecules GRB2 (growth-factor-receptor-bound protein 2), GADS (GRB2-related adaptor protein), SHC (SRC homology 2 (SH2)-domain-containing transforming protein C) and SLP76 (SH2-domain-containing leukocyte protein of 76 kDa), as well as the exchange factors and adaptor molecules VAV and SOS (son of sevenless homologue), and the signalling enzyme phospholipase C gamma1 (PLC-gamma1). Tyrosoine phosphorylation of enzymes and adaptors, including VAV, SHC GRB2 and SOS stimulate small GTPases such as RAC, RAS and RAF. These pathways lead to activation of the ERK, JNK and p38 MAP kinases, histamine release and cytokine production. FCERI activation also triggers the phosphorylation of PLC-gamma which upon membrane localisation hydrolyse PIP2 to form IP3 and 1,2-diacylglycerol (DAG) - second messengers that release Ca2+ from internal stores and activate PKC, respectively. Degranulation or histamine release follows the activation of PLC-gamma and protein kinase C (PKC) and the increased mobilization of calcium (Ca2+). Receptor aggregation also results in the phosphorylation of adaptor protein NTAL/LAT2 which then recruits GAB2. PI3K associates with phosphorylated GAB2 and catalyses the formation of PIP3 in the membrane, which attracts many PH domain proteins like BTK, PLC-gamma, AKT and PDK.

In Drosophila in the absence of Hh signaling, full-length Ci is partially degraded by the proteasome to generate a truncated repressor form that translocates to the nucleus to represses Hh-responsive genes. Binding of Hh ligand to the Patched (PTC) receptor allows the 7-pass transmembrane protein Smoothened (SMO) to be activated in an unknown manner, disrupting the partial proteolysis of Ci and allowing the full length activator form to accumulate (reviewed in Ingham et al, 2011; Briscoe and Therond, 2013).  <br>While many of the core components of Hh signaling are conserved from flies to humans, the pathways do show points of significant divergence. Notably, the human genome encodes three Ci homologues, GLI1, 2 and 3 that each play slightly different roles in regulating Hh responsive genes. GLI3 is the primary repressor of Hh signaling in vertebrates, and is converted to the truncated GLI3R repressor form in the absence of Hh. GLI2 is a potent activator of transcription in the presence of Hh but contributes only minimally to the repression function. While a minor fraction of GLI2 protein is processed into the repressor form in the absence of Hh, the majority is either fully degraded by the proteasome or sequestered in the full-length form in the cytosol by protein-protein interactions. GLI1 lacks the repression domain and appears to be an obligate transcriptional activator (reviewed in Briscoe and Therond, 2013).<br> Vertebrate but not fly Hh signaling also depends on the movement of pathway components through the primary cilium.

ISG15 is then transfered from E1 to the E2 conjugating enzyme UBCH8 and then to the target protein with the aid of an ISG15 E3 ligase, such as HERC5 and EFP.

AMPK is a heterotrimer composed of alpha-catalytic and beta and gamma-regulatory subunits. Humans and rodents have two alpha and beta and three gamma isoforms; some genes are subject to alternative splicing increasing the range of possible heterotrimer combinations. Cellular stresses that inhibit ATP production or increase its consumption change the AMP:ATP ratio and activate the pathway. AMPK activation by AMP is not completely understood; the current model states that binding of AMP to the gamma subunit leads to conformational changes that allosterically activate AMPK and render phosphorylated-Thr172 unavailable for inhibitory dephosphorylation. ATP antagonizes the effect of AMP; both AMP and ATP bind in a mutually exclusive manner to the Bateman (CBS) domains of the gamma subunit. The upstream kinase, known as Lkb1, is a complex of one catalytic and two regulatory subunits; Lkb1 is believed to be 'constitutively active'. In certain cell types, Thr172 can be phosphorylated by calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinases (CAmKK), in turn activated by calcium. A well known role of AMPK is in the regulation of lipid metabolism; it stimulates fatty acids oxidation and inhibits their synthesis. Phosphorylation by AMPK inhibits acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) and results in reduced levels of malonyl-CoA product. Malonyl CoA is a substrate in the de novo synthesis of fatty acids and fatty acids elongation. Importantly, it is also an inhibitor of the carnitine palmitoyl transferase I, required for the transfer of primed cytosolic fatty acids into the mitochondrion where they can undergo degradative beta-oxidation. AMPK inhibits mTOR signaling pathway by activating Tsc2 and downstream of Tsc2 by inhibiting Raptor component of mTOR complex 1 [note that this effect is opposite to Tsc2 phosphorylation and inactivation by PI3K-Akt signaling downstream of insulin]. AMPK is also involved in promoting glucose uptake and utilization and integrates adipokynes and hormonal signals in both the hypothalamus and the periphery with potential impact on energy expenditure and uptake by molecular mechanisms that remain to be established. Due to its roles in fuel regulation, the AMPK pathway is regarded as a potential therapeutic target for diabetes type II, obesity and metabolic syndrome. As a note, drugs used in the treatment of insulin resistance and diabetes can activate AMPK.\n\nAMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) plays a key role as a master regulator of cellular energy homeostasis. The kinase is activated in response to stresses that deplete cellular ATP supplies such as low glucose, hypoxia, ischemia and heat shock. It exists as a heterotrimeric complex composed of a catalytic \u03b1 subunit and regulatory \u03b2 and \u03b3 subunits. Binding of AMP to the \u03b3 subunit allosterically activates the complex, making it a more attractive substrate for its major upstream AMPK kinase, LKB1. Several studies indicate that signaling through adiponectin, leptin and CAMKK\u03b2 may also be important in activating AMPK.\n\nAs a cellular energy sensor responding to low ATP levels, AMPK activation positively regulates signaling pathways that replenish cellular ATP supplies. For example, activation of AMPK enhances both the transcription and translocation of GLUT4, resulting in an increase in insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. In addition, it also stimulates catabolic processes such as fatty acid oxidation and glycolysis via inhibition of ACC and activation of PFK2. AMPK negatively regulates several proteins central to ATP consuming processes such as TORC2, glycogen synthase, SREBP-1 and TSC2, resulting in the downregulation or inhibition of gluconeogenesis, glycogen, lipid and protein synthesis. Due to its role as a central regulator of both lipid and glucose metabolism, AMPK is considered to be a key therapeutic target for the treatment of obesity, type II diabetes mellitus, and cancer.\n\nProteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP1403 CPTAC Assay Portal]", "Pathway Ontology": "AMPK signaling pathway && signaling pathway && ATP biosynthetic pathway && adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling pathway", "Summary": "AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a master regulator of cellular energy homeostasis, acting as a fuel sensor and regulator in various tissues.

MMR is primarily associated with DNA replication and is highly conserved across prokaryotes and eukaryotes. MMR consists of the following basic steps: a sensor (MutS homologue) detects a mismatch or IDL, the sensor activates a set of proteins (a MutL homologue and an exonuclease) that select the nascent DNA strand to be repaired, nick the strand, exonucleolytically remove  a region of nucleotides containing the mismatch, and finally a DNA polymerase resynthesizes the strand and a ligase seals the remaining nick (reviewed in Kolodner and Marsischkny 1999, Iyer et al. 2006, Li 2008, Fukui 2010, Jiricny 2013). <br>Humans have 2 different MutS complexes. The MSH2:MSH6 heterodimer (MutSalpha) recognizes single base mismatches and small loops of one or two unpaired bases. The MSH2:MSH3 heterodimer (MutSbeta) recognizes loops of two or more unpaired bases. Upon binding a mismatch, the MutS complex becomes activated in an ATP-dependent manner allowing for subsequent downstream interactions and movement on the DNA substrate. (There are two mechanisms proposed: a sliding clamp and a switch diffusion model.) Though the order of steps and structural details are not fully known, the activated MutS complex interacts with MLH1:PMS2 (MutLalpha) and PCNA, the sliding clamp present at replication foci. The role of PCNA is multifaceted as it may act as a processivity factor in recruiting MMR proteins to replicating DNA, interact with MLH1:PMS2 and Exonuclease 1 (EXO1) to initiate excision of the recently replicated strand and direct DNA polymerase delta to initiate replacement of bases. MLH1:PMS2 makes an incision in the strand to be repaired and EXO1 extends the incision to make a single-stranded gap of up to 1 kb that removes the mismatched base(s). (Based on assays of purified human proteins, there is also a variant of the mismatch repair pathway that does not require EXO1, however the mechanism is not clear. EXO1 is almost always required, it is possible that the exonuclease activity of DNA polymerase delta may compensate in some situations and it has been proposed that other endonucleases may perform redundant functions in the absence of EXO1.) RPA binds the single-stranded region and a new strand is synthesized across the gap by DNA polymerase delta. The remaining nick is sealed by DNA ligase I (LIG1).<br>Concentrations of MMR proteins MSH2:MSH6 and MLH1:PMS2 increase in human cells during S phase and are at their highest level and activity during this phase of the cell cycle (Edelbrock et al. 2009).

During this process the preadipocytes cease to proliferate, begin to accumulate lipid droplets and develop morphologic and biochemical characteristics of mature adipocytes such as hormone responsive lipogenenic and lipolytic programs. The most intensively studied model system for adipogenesis is differentiation of the mouse 3T3-L1 preadipocyte cell line by an induction cocktail of containing mitogens (insulin/IGF1), glucocorticoid (dexamethasone), an inducer of cAMP (IBMX), and fetal serum (Cao et al. 1991, reviewed in Farmer 2006). More recently additional cellular models have become available to study adipogenesis that involve almost all stages of development (reviewed in Rosen and MacDougald 2006). In vivo knockout mice lacking putative adipogenic factors have also been extensively studied. Human pathways are traditionally inferred from those discovered in mouse but are now beginning to be validated in cellular models derived from human adipose progenitors (Fischer-Posovszky et al. 2008, Wdziekonski et al. 2011).<br>Adipogenesis is controlled by a cascade of transcription factors (Yeh et al. 1995, reviewed in Farmer 2006, Gesta et al. 2007). One of the first observable events during adipocyte differentiation is a transient increase in expression of the CEBPB (CCAAT/Enhancer Binding Protein Beta, C/EBPB) and CEBPD (C/EBPD) transcription factors (Cao et al. 1991, reviewed in Lane et al. 1999). This occurs prior to the accumulation of lipid droplets. However, it is the subsequent inductions of CEBPA and PPARG that are critical for morphological, biochemical and functional adipocytes.<br>Ectopic expression of CEBPB alone is capable of inducing substantial adipocyte differentiation in fibroblasts while CEBPD has a minimal effect. CEBPB is upregulated in response to intracellular cAMP (possibly via pCREB) and serum mitogens (possibly via Krox20). CEBPD is upregulated in response to glucocorticoids. The exact mechanisms that upregulate the CEBPs are not fully known.<br>CEBPB and CEBPD act directly on the Peroxisome Proliferator-activated Receptor Gamma (PPARG) gene by binding its promoter and activating transcription. CEBPB and CEBPD also directly activate the EBF1 gene (and possibly other EBFs) and KLF5 (Jimenez et al. 2007, Oishi 2005). The EBF1 and KLF5 proteins, in turn bind, and activate the PPARG promoter. Other hormones, such as insulin, affect PPARG expression and other transcription factors, such as ADD1/SREBP1c, bind the PPARG promoter. This is an area of ongoing research.<br>During adipogenesis the PPARG gene is transcribed to yield 2 variants. The adipogenic variant 2 mRNA encodes 30 additional amino acids at the N-terminus compared to the widely expressed variant 1 mRNA.<br>PPARG encodes a type II nuclear hormone receptor (remains in the nucleus in the absence of ligand) that forms a heterodimer with the Retinoid X Receptor Alpha (RXRA). The heterodimer was initially identified as a complex regulating the aP2/FABP4 gene and named ARF6 (Tontonoz et al. 1994).<br>The PPARG:RXRA heterodimer binds a recognition sequence that consists of two hexanucleotide motifs (DR1 motifs) separated by 1 nucleotide. Binding occurs even in the absence of ligands, such as fatty acids, that activate PPARG. In the absence of activating ligands, the PPARG:RXRA complex recruits repressors of transcription such as SMRT/NCoR2, NCoR1, and HDAC3 (Tontonoz and Spiegelman 2008).<br>Each molecule of PPARG can bind 2 molecules of activating ligands. Although, the identity of the endogenous ligands of PPARG is unknown, exogenous activators include fatty acids and the thiazolidinedione class of antidiabetic drugs (reviewed in Berger et al. 2005, Heikkinen et al. 2007, Lemberger et al. 1996). The most potent activators of PPARG in vitro are oxidized derivatives of unsaturated fatty acids.. Upon binding activating ligands PPARG causes a rearrangement of adjacent factors: Corepressors such as SMRT/NCoR2 are lost and coactivators such as TIF2, PRIP, CBP, and p300 are recruited (Tontonoz and Spiegelman). PPARG also binds directly to the TRAP220 subunit of the TRAP/Mediator complex that recruits RNA polymerase II. Thus binding of activating ligand by PPARG causes transcription of PPARG target genes.<br>Targets of PPARG include genes involved in differentiation (PGAR/HFARP, Perilipin, aP2/FABP4, CEBPA), fatty acid transport (LPL, FAT/CD36), carbohydrate metabolism (PEPCK-C, AQP7, GK, GLUT4 (SLC2A4)), and energy homeostasis (LEPTIN and ADIPONECTIN) (Perera et al. 2006).<br>Within 10 days of differentiation CEBPB and CEBPD are no longer located at the PPARG promoter. Instead CEBPA is present. EBF1 and PPARG bind the CEBPA promoter and activate transcription of CEBPA, one of the key transcription factors in adipogenesis. A current hypothesis posits a self-reinforcing loop that maintains PPARG expression and the differentiated state: PPARG activates CEBPA and CEBPA activates PPARG. Additionally EBF1 (and possibly other EBFs) activates CEBPA, CEBPA activates EBF1, and EBF1 activates PPARG.\n View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=381340 Reactome].", "Pathway Ontology": "regulatory pathway", "Cell Type": "white fat cell", "Summary": "Adipogenesis is the process of cell differentiation by which preadipocytes become adipocytes.

TP53 regulates transcription of many genes involved in the metabolism of carbohydrates, nucleotides and amino acids, protein synthesis and aerobic respiration.<p>TP53 stimulates transcription of TIGAR, a D-fructose 2,6-bisphosphatase. TIGAR activity decreases glycolytic rate and lowers ROS (reactive oxygen species) levels in cells (Bensaad et al. 2006). TP53 may also negatively regulate the rate of glycolysis by inhibiting the expression of glucose transporters GLUT1, GLUT3 and GLUT4 (Kondoh et al. 2005, Schwartzenberg-Bar-Yoseph et al. 2004, Kawauchi et al. 2008).<p>TP53 negatively regulates several key points in PI3K/AKT signaling and downstream mTOR signaling, decreasing the rate of protein synthesis and, hence, cellular growth. TP53 directly stimulates transcription of the tumor suppressor PTEN, which acts to inhibit PI3K-mediated activation of AKT (Stambolic et al. 2001). TP53 stimulates transcription of sestrin genes, SESN1, SESN2, and SESN3 (Velasco-Miguel et al. 1999, Budanov et al. 2002, Brynczka et al. 2007). One of sestrin functions may be to reduce and reactivate overoxidized peroxiredoxin PRDX1, thereby reducing ROS levels (Budanov et al. 2004, Papadia et al. 2008, Essler et al. 2009). Another function of sestrins is to bind the activated AMPK complex and protect it from AKT-mediated inactivation. By enhancing AMPK activity, sestrins negatively regulate mTOR signaling (Budanov and Karin 2008, Cam et al. 2014). The expression of DDIT4 (REDD1), another negative regulator of mTOR signaling, is directly stimulated by TP63 and TP53. DDIT4 prevents AKT-mediated inactivation of TSC1:TSC2 complex, thus inhibiting mTOR cascade (Cam et al. 2014, Ellisen et al. 2002, DeYoung et al. 2008). TP53 may also be involved, directly or indirectly, in regulation of expression of other participants of PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling, such as PIK3CA (Singh et al. 2002), TSC2 and AMPKB (Feng et al. 2007). <p>TP53 regulates mitochondrial metabolism through several routes. TP53 stimulates transcription of SCO2 gene, which encodes a mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase assembly protein (Matoba et al. 2006). TP53 stimulates transcription of RRM2B gene, which encodes a subunit of the ribonucleotide reductase complex, responsible for the conversion of ribonucleotides to deoxyribonucleotides and essential for the maintenance of mitochondrial DNA content in the cell (Tanaka et al. 2000, Bourdon et al. 2007, Kulawiec et al. 2009). TP53 also transactivates mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM), a nuclear-encoded gene important for mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) transcription and maintenance (Park et al. 2009). Finally, TP53 stimulates transcription of the mitochondrial glutaminase GLS2, leading to increased mitochondrial respiration rate and reduced ROS levels (Hu et al. 2010). <p>The great majority of tumor cells generate energy through aerobic glycolysis, rather than the much more efficient aerobic mitochondrial respiration, and this metabolic change is known as the Warburg effect (Warburg 1956). Since the majority of tumor cells have impaired TP53 function, and TP53 regulates a number of genes involved in glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration, it is likely that TP53 inactivation plays an important role in the metabolic derangement of cancer cells such as the Warburg effect and the concomitant increased tumorigenicity (reviewed by Feng and Levine 2010). On the other hand, some mutations of TP53 in Li-Fraumeni syndrome may result in the retention of its wild-type metabolic activities while losing cell cycle and apoptosis functions (Wang et al. 2013). Consistent with such human data, some mutations of p53, unlike p53 null state, retain the ability to regulate energy metabolism while being inactive in regulating its classic gene targets involved in cell cycle, apoptosis and senescence. Retention of metabolic and antioxidant functions of p53 protects p53 mutant mice from early onset tumorigenesis (Li et al. 2012). \n View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=5628897 Reactome].", "Pathway Ontology": "regulatory pathway && classic metabolic pathway", "Summary": "The TP53 tumor suppressor protein plays a crucial role in regulating cell metabolism to prevent tumor development.

KAT6A-mediated acetylation increases transcriptional activation of CDKN1A by TP53 (Rokudai et al. 2013).

Recruitment of mTORC1 to the lysosomal membrane is intricate and incompletely understood. At the center of the system is a complex of two small GTPases, the Rag heterodimer (RRAGA or RRAGB bound to RRAGC or RRAGD). The Rag heterodimer is tethered to the membrane by the Ragulator complex, which also binds the v-ATPase complex. The Rag heterodimer acts as a cross-regulating switch, with the binding of GTP by one subunit inhibiting the exchange of GDP for GTP by the other subunit (Shen et al. 2017). The active conformation of the Rag heterodimer that recruits mTORC1 to the lysosomal membrane is RRAGA,B:GTP:RRAGC,D:GDP while the inactive conformation, RRAGA,B:GDP:RRAGC,D:GTP, releases mTORC1 (Sancak et al. 2008, Kim et al. 2008, Sancak et al. 2010, Lawrence et al. 2018). GTPase activating proteins (GAPs) and guanyl nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) acting upon the Rag heterodimer thereby regulate recruitment of mTORC1. RHEB:GTP at the lysosomal membrane also binds mTORC1 and directly activates mTORC1. During inactivation of mTORC1 in response to removal of amino acids, the TSC complex, a GAP for RHEB, is required in addition to the inactive Rag complex to release mTORC1 from RHEB and hence fully release mTORC1 from the lysosomal membrane (Demetriades et al. 2014).<br>Amino acids regulate recruitment of mTORC1 to the lysosomal membrane by at least 4 mechanisms (reviewed in Zhuang et al. 2019, Wolfson and Sabatini 2017, Yao et al. 2017). 1) Sestrin1 (SESN1) or Sestrin2 (SESN2) binds leucine and the Sestrin1,2:leucine complex is then released from the GATOR2 complex, allowing GATOR2 to positively regulate mTORC1 activation (Chantranupong et al. 2014, Parmigiani et al. 2014, Kim et al. 2015, Wolfson et al. 2016, Saxton et al. 2016). 2) CASTOR1 in a homodimer or a heterodimer with CASTOR2 binds arginine and the CASTOR1:arginine complex is likewise released from GATOR2, allowing GATOR2 to activate mTORC1 (Chantranupong et al. 2016, Saxton et al. 2016, Gai et al. 2016, Xia et al. 2016). 3) BMT2 (SAMTOR), a negative regulator of mTORC1 activation, binds S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), a derivative of methionine (Gu et al. 2017). The binding of SAM causes BMT2 to dissociate from GATOR1, allowing the activation of mTORC1. 4) The amino acid transporter SLC38A9 binds arginine and SLC38A9 then acts as a GEF to convert RRAGA,B:GDP to the active form, RRAGA,B:GTP (Rebsamen et al. 2015, Wang et al. 2015, Wyant et al. 2017, Shen and Sabatini 2018).

P1 is more than 7 kb upstream of P2 (Ghozi et al. 1996). In mice, the Runx1 gene is preferentially transcribed from the proximal P2 promoter during generation of hematopoietic cells from hemogenic endothelium. In fully committed hematopoietic progenitors, the Runx1 gene is preferentially transcribed from the distal P1 promoter (Sroczynska et al. 2009, Bee et al. 2010). In human T cells, RUNX1 is preferentially transcribed from P1 throughout development, while developing natural killer cells transcribe RUNX1 predominantly from P2. Developing B cells transcribe low levels of RUNX1 from both promoters (Telfer and Rothenberg 2001).<br>RUNX1 mRNAs transcribed from alternative promoters differ in their 5'UTRs and splicing isoforms of RUNX1 have also been described. The function of alternative splice isoforms and alternative 5'UTRs has not been fully elucidated (Challen and Goodell 2010, Komeno et al. 2014).<br>During zebrafish hematopoiesis, RUNX1 expression increases in response to NOTCH signaling, but direct transcriptional regulation of RUNX1 by NOTCH has not been demonstrated (Burns et al. 2005). RUNX1 transcription also increases in response to WNT signaling. BothTCF7 and TCF4 bind the RUNX1 promoter (Wu et al. 2012, Hoverter et al. 2012), and RUNX1 transcription driven by the TCF binding element (TBE) in response to WNT3A treatment is inhibited by the dominant-negative mutant of TCF4 (Medina et al. 2016). In developing mouse ovary, Runx1 expression is positively regulated by Wnt4 signaling (Naillat et al. 2015).<br>Studies in mouse hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells imply that RUNX1 may be a direct transcriptional target of HOXB4 (Oshima et al. 2011).<br>Conserved cis-regulatory elements were recently identified in intron 5 of RUNX1. The RUNX1 breakpoints observed in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with translocation (8;21), which result in expression of a fusion RUNX1-ETO protein, cluster in intron 5, in proximity to these not yet fully characterized cis regulatory elements (Rebolledo-Jaramillo et al. 2014).<br>At the level of translation, RUNX1 expression is regulated by various microRNAs which bind to the 3'UTR of RUNX1 mRNA and inhibit its translation through endonucleolytic and/or nonendonucleolytic mechanisms. MicroRNAs that target RUNX1 include miR-378 (Browne et al. 2016), miR-302b (Ge et al. 2014), miR-18a (Miao et al. 2015), miR-675 (Zhuang et al. 2014), miR-27a (Ben-Ami et al. 2009), miR-17, miR-20a, miR106 (Fontana et al. 2007) and miR-215 (Li et al. 2016).<br>At the posttranslational level, RUNX1 activity is regulated by postranslational modifications and binding to co-factors. SRC family kinases phosphorylate RUNX1 on multiple tyrosine residues in the negative regulatory domain, involved in autoinhibition of RUNX1. RUNX1 tyrosine phosphorylation correlates with reduced binding of RUNX1 to GATA1 and increased binding of RUNX1 to the SWI/SNF complex, leading to inhibition of RUNX1-mediated differentiation of T-cells and megakaryocytes. SHP2 (PTPN11) tyrosine phosphatase binds to RUNX1 and dephosphorylates it (Huang et al. 2012).<br>Formation of the complex with CBFB is necessary for the transcriptional activity of RUNX1 (Wang et al. 1996). Binding of CCND3 and probably other two cyclin D family members, CCND1 and CCND2, to RUNX1 inhibits its association with CBFB (Peterson et al. 2005), while binding to CDK6 interferes with binding of RUNX1 to DNA without affecting formation of the RUNX1:CBFB complex. Binding of RUNX1 to PML plays a role in subnuclear targeting of RUNX1 (Nguyen et al. 2005).<br>RUNX1 activity and protein levels vary during the cell cycle. RUNX1 protein levels increase from G1 to S and from S to G2 phases, with no increase in RUNX1 mRNA levels.

Some of TP53 targets, such as BAX, BID, PMAIP1 (NOXA), BBC3 (PUMA) and probably BNIP3L, AIFM2, STEAP3, TRIAP1 and TP53AIP1, regulate the permeability of the mitochondrial membrane and/or cytochrome C release (Miyashita and Reed 1995, Oda et al. 2000, Samuels-Lev et al. 2001, Nakano and Vousden 2001, Sax et al. 2002, Passer et al. 2003, Bergamaschi et al. 2004, Li et al. 2004, Fei et al. 2004, Wu et al. 2004, Park and Nakamura 2005, Patel et al. 2008, Wang et al. 2012, Wilson et al. 2013). Other pro-apoptotic genes, either involved in the intrinsic apoptosis pathway, extrinsic apoptosis pathway or pyroptosis (inflammation-related cell death), which are transcriptionally regulated by TP53 are cytosolic caspase activators, such as APAF1, PIDD1, and NLRC4, and caspases themselves, such as CASP1, CASP6 and CASP10 (Lin et al. 2000, Robles et al. 2001, Gupta et al. 2001, MacLachlan and El-Deiry 2002, Rikhof et al. 2003, Sadasivam et al. 2005, Brough and Rothwell 2007).<p>It is uncertain how exactly some of the pro-apoptotic TP53 targets, such as TP53I3 (PIG3), RABGGTA, BCL2L14, BCL6, NDRG1 and PERP contribute to apoptosis (Attardi et al. 2000, Guo et al. 2001, Samuels-Lev et al. 2001, Contente et al. 2002, Ihrie et al. 2003, Bergamaschi et al. 2004, Stein et al. 2004, Phan and Dalla-Favera 2004, Jen and Cheung 2005, Margalit et al. 2006, Zhang et al. 2007, Saito et al. 2009, Davies et al. 2009, Giam et al. 2012).<p>TP53 is stabilized in response to cellular stress by phosphorylation on at least serine residues S15 and S20. Since TP53 stabilization precedes the activation of cell death genes, the TP53 tetramer phosphorylated at S15 and S20 is shown as a regulator of pro-apoptotic/pro-cell death genes. Some pro-apoptotic TP53 target genes, such as TP53AIP1, require additional phosphorylation of TP53 at serine residue S46 (Oda et al. 2000, Taira et al. 2007).

In Drosophila in the absence of Hh signaling, full-length Ci is partially degraded by the proteasome to generate a truncated repressor form that translocates to the nucleus to represses Hh-responsive genes. Binding of Hh ligand to the Patched (PTC) receptor allows the 7-pass transmembrane protein Smoothened (SMO) to be activated in an unknown manner, disrupting the partial proteolysis of Ci and allowing the full length activator form to accumulate (reviewed in Ingham et al, 2011; Briscoe and Therond, 2013).  <br>While many of the core components of Hh signaling are conserved from flies to humans, the pathways do show points of significant divergence. Notably, the human genome encodes three Ci homologues, GLI1, 2 and 3 that each play slightly different roles in regulating Hh responsive genes. GLI3 is the primary repressor of Hh signaling in vertebrates, and is converted to the truncated GLI3R repressor form in the absence of Hh. GLI2 is a potent activator of transcription in the presence of Hh but contributes only minimally to the repression function. While a minor fraction of GLI2 protein is processed into the repressor form in the absence of Hh, the majority is either fully degraded by the proteasome or sequestered in the full-length form in the cytosol by protein-protein interactions. GLI1 lacks the repression domain and appears to be an obligate transcriptional activator (reviewed in Briscoe and Therond, 2013).<br> Vertebrate but not fly Hh signaling also depends on the movement of pathway components through the primary cilium. The primary cilium is a non-motile microtubule based structure whose construction and maintenance depends on intraflagellar transport (IFT). Anterograde IFT moves molecules from the ciliary base along the axoneme to the ciliary tip in a manner that requires the microtubule-plus-end directed kinesin KIF3 motor complex and the IFT-B protein complex, while retrograde IFT back to the ciliary base depends on the minus-end directed dynein motor and the IFT-A complex.

Under normal physiological conditions TNFR2 exhibits more restricted expression, being found on certain subpopulation of immune cells and few other cell types (Grell et al. 1995 ). TNFR1 mediated signalling pathways have been very well characterized but, TNFR2 has been much less well studied. TNFR1 upon activation by TNFA activates apoptosis through two pathways, involving the adaptor proteins TNFR1-associated death domain (TRADD) and fas-associated death domain (FADD). In contrast, TNFR2 signalling especially in highly activated T cells, induces cell survival pathways that can result in cell proliferation by activating transcription factor NF-kB (nuclear factor-kB) via the alternative non-canonical route. TNFR2 signalling seems to play an important role, in particular for the function of regulatory T cells. It offers protective roles in several disorders, including autoimmune diseases, heart diseases, demyelinating and neurodegenerative disorders and infectious diseases (Faustman & Davis 2010).<br>Activation of the non-canonical pathway by TNFR2 is mediated through a signalling complex that includes TNF receptor-associated factor (TRAF2 and TRAF3), cellular inhibitor of apoptosis (cIAP1 and cIAP2), and NF-kB-inducing kinase (NIK). In this complex TRAF3 functions as a bridging factor between the cIAP1/2:TRAF2 complex and NIK. In resting cells cIAP1/2 in the signalling complex mediates K48-linked polyubiquitination of NIK and subsequent proteasomal degradation making NIK levels invisible. Upon TNFR2 stimulation, TRAF2 is recruited to the intracellular TRAF binding motif and this also indirectly recruits TRAF1 and cIAP1/2, as well as TRAF3 and NIK which are already bound to TRAF2 in unstimulated cells. TRAF2 mediates K63-linked ubiquitination of cIAP1/2 and this in turn mediates cIAP dependent K48-linked ubiquitination of TRAF3 leading to the proteasome-dependent degradation of the latter. As TRAF3 is degraded, NIK can no longer interact with TRAF1/2:cIAP complex. As a result NIK concentration in the cytosol increases and NIK gets stabilised and activated.

This leads to the activation of T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancing factor (TCF/LEF)-dependent transcription, which controls processes such as cell fate, proliferation, and self-renewal of stem cells.

The major function of the Robo receptors is to mediate repulsion of the navigating growth cones. There are four human Robo homologues, ROBO1, ROBO2, ROBO3 and ROBO4. Most of the ROBOs have the similar ectodomain architecture as the cell adhesion molecules, with five Ig domains followed by three FN3 repeats, except for ROBO4. ROBO4 has two Ig and two FN3 repeats. The cytoplasmic domains of ROBO receptors are in general poorly conserved. However, there are four short conserved cytoplasmic sequence motifs, named CC0-3, that serve as binding sites for adaptor proteins. The ligands for the human ROBO1 and ROBO2 receptors are the three SLIT proteins SLIT1, SLIT2, and SLIT3; all of the SLIT proteins contain a tandem of four LRR (leucine rich repeat) domains at the N-terminus, termed D1-D4, followed by six EGF (epidermal growth factor)-like domains, a laminin G like domain (ALPS), three EGF-like domains, and a C-terminal cysteine knot domain. Most SLIT proteins are cleaved within the EGF-like region by unknown proteases (reviewed by Hohenster 2008, Ypsilanti and Chedotal 2014, Blockus and Chedotal 2016). NELL2 is a ligand for ROBO3 (Jaworski et al. 2015).<br><br>SLIT protein binding modulates ROBO interactions with the cytosolic adaptors. The cytoplasmic domain of ROBO1 and ROBO2 determines the repulsive responses of these receptors.

As MKs mature they undergo endoreduplication (polyploidisation) and expansion of cytoplasmic mass to cell sizes larger than 50-100 microns, and ploidy ranges up to 128 N. As MKs mature, the polyploid nucleus becomes horseshoe-shaped, the cytoplasm expands, and platelet organelles and the demarcation membrane system are amplified. Proplatelet projections form which give rise to de novo circulating platelets (Deutsch & Tomer 2006).  <br>The processes of megakaryocytopoiesis and platelet production occur within a complex microenvironment where chemokines, cytokines and adhesive interactions play major roles (Avecilla et al. 2004). Megakaryocytopoiesis is regulated at several levels including proliferation, differentiation and platelet release (Kaushansky 2003). Thrombopoietin (TPO/c-Mpl ligand) is the most potent cytokine stimulating proliferation and maturation of MK progenitors (Kaushansky 2005) but many other growth factors are involved. MK development is controlled by the action of multiple transcription factors. Many MK-specific genes are co-regulated by GATA and friend of GATA (FOG), RUNX1 and ETS proteins. Nuclear factor erythroid 2 (NF-E2), which has an MK-erythroid specific 45-kDa subunit, controls terminal MK maturation, proplatelet formation and platelet release (Schulze & Shivdasani 2004). NF-E2 deficient mice have profound thrombocytopenia (Shiraga et al. 1999). MYB (c-myb) functions with EP300 (p300) as a negative regulator of thrombopoiesis (Metcalf et al. 2005). During MK maturation, internal membrane systems, granules and organelles are assembled. Cytoplasmic fragmentation requires changes in the MK cytoskeleton and formation of organelles and channels. Individual organelles migrate from the cell body to the proplatelet ends, with approximately 30 percent of organelles/granules in motion at any given time (Richardson et al. 2005).\n View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=983231 Reactome].", "Pathway Ontology": "hemostasis pathway", "Summary": "Megakaryocyte development and platelet production involve the terminal differentiation of megakaryocytes, which release cytoplasmic fragments as circulating platelets.

Patients with FA have been categorized into at least 15 complementation groups (FA-A, -B, -C, -D1, -D2, -E, -F, -G, -I, -J, -L, -M, -N, -O and -P). These complementation groups correspond to the genes FANCA, FANCB, FANCC, FANCD1/BRCA2, FANCD2, FANCE, FANCF, FANCG, FANCJ/BRIP1, FANCL, FANCM, FANCN/PALB2, FANCO/RAD51C and FANCP/SLX4. Eight of these proteins, FANCA, FANCB, FANCC, FANCE, FANCF, FANCG, FANCL, and FANCM, together with FAAP24, FAAP100, FAAP20, APITD1 and STRA13, form a nuclear complex termed the FA core complex. The FA core complex is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that recognizes and is activated by DNA damage in the form of interstrand crosslinks (ICLs), triggering monoubiquitination of FANCD2 and FANCI, which initiates repair of ICL-DNA.<p>FANCD2 and FANCI form a complex and are mutually dependent on one another for their respective monoubiquitination. After DNA damage and during S phase, FANCD2 localizes to discrete nuclear foci that colocalize with proteins involved in homologous recombination repair, such as BRCA1 and RAD51. The FA pathway is regulated by ubiquitination and phosphorylation of FANCD2 and FANCI. ATR-dependent phosphorylation of FANCI and FANCD2 promotes monoubiquitination of FANCD2, stimulating the FA pathway (Cohn and D'Andrea 2008, Wang 2007). The complex of USP1 and WDR48 (UAF1) is responsible for deubiquitination of FANCD2 and negatively regulates the FA pathway (Cohn et al. 2007). <p>Monoubiquitinated FANCD2 recruits DNA nucleases, including SLX4 (FANCP) and FAN1, which unhook the ICL from one of the two covalently linked DNA strands. The DNA polymerase nu (POLN) performs translesion DNA synthesis using the DNA strand with unhooked ICL as a template, thereby bypassing the unhooked ICL. The unhooked ICL is subsequently removed from the DNA via nucleotide excision repair (NER). Incision of the stalled replication fork during the unhooking step generates a double strand break (DSB). The DSB is repaired via homologous recombination repair (HRR) and involves the FA genes BRCA2 (FANCD1), PALB2 (FANCN) and BRIP1 (FANCJ) (reviewed by Deans and West 2011, Kottemann and Smogorzewska 2013). Homozygous mutations in BRCA2, PALB2 or BRIP1 result in Fanconi anemia, while heterozygous mutations in these genes predispose carriers to primarily breast and ovarian cancer. Well established functions of BRCA2, PALB2 and BRIP1 in DNA repair are BRCA1 dependent, but it is not yet clear whether there are additional roles for these proteins in the Fanconi anemia pathway that do not rely on BRCA1 (Evans and Longo 2014, Jiang and Greenberg 2015). Heterozygous BRCA1 mutations predispose carriers to breast and ovarian cancer with high penetrance. Complete loss of BRCA1 function is embryonic lethal. It has only recently been reported that a partial germline loss of BRCA1 function via mutations that diminish protein binding ability of the BRCT domain of BRCA1 result in a FA-like syndrome. BRCA1 has therefore been designated as the FANCS gene (Jiang and Greenberg 2015).<p>The FA pathway is involved in repairing DNA ICLs that arise by exposure to endogenous mutagens produced as by-products of normal cellular metabolism, such as aldehyde containing compounds. Disruption of the aldehyde dehydrogenase gene ALDH2 in FANCD2 deficient mice leads to severe developmental defects, early lethality and predisposition to leukemia. In addition to this, the double knockout mice are exceptionally sensitive to ethanol consumption, as ethanol metabolism results in accumulated levels of aldehydes (Langevin et al. 2011).  \n View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=6783310 Reactome].", "Disease": "Fanconi's anemia", "Pathway Ontology": "DNA repair pathway && disease pathway", "Summary": "The Fanconi Anemia pathway is a critical cellular mechanism that repairs interstrand crosslinks (ICLs) in DNA, which are formed by exposure to endogenous mutagens such as aldehyde-containing compounds.

Therefore, while their mRNAs are homologous and are both translationally inhibited by miR-24 microRNA (Lal et al. 2008, To et al. 2012), they share no similarity at the amino acid sequence level and perform distinct functions in the cell. p16INK4A acts as the inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases CDK4 and CDK6 which phosphorylate and inhibit RB1 protein thereby promoting G1 to S transition and cell cycle progression (Serrano et al. 1993). Increased p16INK4A level leads to hypophosphorylation of RB1, allowing RB1 to inhibit transcription of E2F1, E2F2 and E2F3-target genes that are needed for cell cycle progression, which results in cell cycle arrest in G1 phase. p14-ARF binds and destabilizes MDM2 ubiquitin ligase (Zhang et al. 1998), responsible for ubiquitination and degradation of TP53 (p53) tumor suppressor protein (Wu et al. 1993, Fuchs et al. 1998, Fang et al. 2000).

CDKN2B locus, which encodes an inhibitor of CDK4 and CDK6, p15INK4B, is located in the vicinity of CDKN2A locus, at the chromosome band 9p21. p15INK4B, together with p16INK4A, contributes to senescence of human T-lymphocytes (Erickson et al. 1998) and mouse fibroblasts (Malumbres et al. 2000). SMAD3, activated by TGF-beta-1 signaling, controls senescence in the mouse multistage carcinogenesis model through regulation of MYC and p15INK4B gene expression (Vijayachandra et al. 2003). TGF-beta-induced p15INK4B expression is also important for the senescence of hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines (Senturk et al. 2010).<p>MAP kinases MAPK1 (ERK2) and MAPK3 (ERK1), which are activated by RAS signaling, phosphorylate ETS1 and ETS2 transcription factors in the nucleus (Yang et al. 1996, Seidel et al. 2002, Foulds et al. 2004, Nelson et al. 2010). Phosphorylated ETS1 and ETS2 are able to bind RAS response elements (RREs) in the CDKN2A locus and stimulate p16INK4A transcription (Ohtani et al. 2004). At the same time, activated ERKs (MAPK1 i.e. ERK2 and MAPK3 i.e. ERK1) phosphorylate ERF, the repressor of ETS2 transcription, which leads to translocation of ERF to the cytosol and increased transcription of ETS2 (Sgouras et al. 1995, Le Gallic et al. 2004). ETS2 can be sequestered and inhibited by binding to ID1, resulting in inhibition of p16INK4A transcription (Ohtani et al. 2004).<br><br>Transcription of p14ARF is stimulated by binding of E2F transcription factors (E2F1, E2F2 or E2F3) in complex with SP1 to p14ARF promoter (Parisi et al. 2002).<br><br>Oncogenic RAS signaling affects mitochondrial metabolism through an unknown mechanism, leading to increased generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which triggers oxidative stress induced senescence pathway.

This signaling pathway can also be triggered by high transcriptional activity of E2F1, E2F2, or E2F3, which can result from the loss-of-function of the RB1 tumor suppressor. Oncogenic signals activate the transcription of CDKN2A locus tumor suppressor genes, including p16INK4A and p14ARF, which play distinct roles in cell cycle regulation. p16INK4A inhibits cyclin-dependent kinases CDK4 and CDK6, leading to cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase, while p14ARF binds and destabilizes MDM2, resulting in increased levels of the TP53 tumor suppressor protein and the activation of TP53 target genes, including p21, which triggers cell cycle arrest and may lead to apoptosis.

Both subunits contain extracellular conserved motifs typical of the cytokine receptor superfamily. The cytoplasmic domains have limited similarity with other cytokine receptors and lack detectable catalytic domains such as tyrosine kinase domains.<br><br> IL-3 is a 20-26 kDa product of CD4+ T cells that acts on the most immature marrow progenitors. IL-3 is capable of inducing the growth and differentiation of multi-potential hematopoietic stem cells, neutrophils, eosinophils, megakaryocytes, macrophages, lymphoid and erythroid cells. IL-3 has been used to support the proliferation of murine cell lines with properties of multi-potential progenitors, immature myeloid as well as T and pre-B lymphoid cells (Miyajima et al. 1992). IL-5 is a hematopoietic growth factor responsible for the maturation and differentiation of eosinophils. It was originally defined as a T-cell-derived cytokine that triggers activated B cells for terminal differentiation into antibody-secreting plasma cells. It also promotes the generation of cytotoxic T-cells from thymocytes. IL-5 induces the expression of IL-2 receptors (Kouro & Takatsu 2009). GM-CSF is produced by cells (T-lymphocytes, tissue macrophages, endothelial cells, mast cells) found at sites of inflammatory responses. It stimulates the growth and development of progenitors of granulocytes and macrophages, and the production and maturation of dendritic cells. It stimulates myeloblast and monoblast differentiation, synergises with Epo in the proliferation of erythroid and megakaryocytic  progenitor cells, acts as an autocrine mediator of growth for some types of acute myeloid leukemia, is a strong chemoattractant for neutrophils and eosinophils. It enhances the activity of neutrophils and macrophages. Under steady-state conditions GM-CSF is not essential for the production of myeloid cells, but it is required for the proper development of alveolar macrophages, otherwise, pulmonary alvelolar proteinosis (PAP) develops. A growing body of evidence suggests that GM-CSF plays a key role in emergency hematopoiesis (predominantly myelopoiesis)  in response to infection, including the production of granulocytes and macrophages in the bone marrow and their maintenance, survival, and functional activation at sites of injury or insult  (Hercus et al. 2009).<br><br> All three receptors have alpha chains that bind their specific ligands with low affinity (de Groot et al. 1998).

The cytoplasmic domain of Bc has two distinct functional domains: the membrane proximal region mediates the induction of proliferation-associated genes such as c-myc, pim-1 and oncostatin M. This region binds multiple signal-transducing proteins including JAK2 (Quelle et al. 1994), STATs, c-Src and PI3 kinase (Rao and Mufson, 1995). The membrane distal domain is required for cytokine-induced growth inhibition and is necessary for the viability of hematopoietic cells (Inhorn et al. 1995).

The natural ligands of NR1H2 and NR1H3 are oxysterols (e.g., 24(S),25-epoxycholesterol, 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol (OH), 25-OH, and 27-OH) that are produced endogenously by enzymatic reactions, by reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent oxidation of cholesterol and by the alimentary processes (reviewed in:Jakobsson T et al. 2012; Huang C 2014; Komati R et al. 2017). It has been shown that these oxysterols bind directly to the ligand-binding domain of LXRs with Kd values ranging from 0.1 to 0.4\u00e2\u20ac\u0160microM. 24(S), 25-epoxycholesterol was found to be the most potent endogenous agonist (Janowski BA et al. 1999). NR1H3 (LXR\u00ce\u00b1) and NR1H2 (LXR\u00ce\u00b2) showed similar affinities for these compounds (Janowski BA et al. 1999). In physiological conditions, oxysterols are formed in amounts proportional to cholesterol content in the cell and therefore the LXRs operate as cholesterol sensors to alter gene expression and protect the cells from cholesterol overload via: (1) inhibiting intestinal cholesterol absorption; (2) stimulating cholesterol efflux from cells to high-density lipoproteins through the ATP-binding cassette transporters ABCA1 and ABCG1: (3) activating the conversion of cholesterol to bile acids in the liver; and (4) activating biliary cholesterol and bile acid excretion (reviewed in: W\u00c3\u00b3jcicka G et al. 2007; Baranowski M 2008; Laurencikiene J & Ryd\u00c3\u00a9n M 2012; Edwards PA et al. 2002; Zelcer N & Tontonoz P 2006; Zhao C & Dahlman-Wright K 2010). In addition, LXR agonists enhance de novo fatty acid synthesis by stimulating the expression of a lipogenic transcription factor, sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c), leading to the elevation of plasma triglycerides and hepatic steatosis (W\u00c3\u00b3jcicka G et al. 2007; Baranowski M 2008; Laurencikiene J & Ryd\u00c3\u00a9n M 2012). In addition to their function in lipid metabolism, NR1H2,3 have also been found to modulate immune and inflammatory responses in macrophages (Zelcer N & Tontonoz P 2006). The NR1H2 and NR1H3 molecules can be viewed as having four functional domains: (1) an amino-terminal ligand-independent activation function domain (AF-1), which may stimulate transcription in the absence of ligand; (2) a DNA-binding domain (DBD) containing two zinc fingers; (3) a hydrophobic ligand-binding domain (LBD) required for ligand binding and receptor dimerization; and, (4) a carboxy-terminal ligand-dependent transactivation sequence (also referred to as the activation function-2 (AF-2) domain) that stimulates transcription in response to ligand binding (Robinson-Rechavi M et al. 2003; Jakobsson T et al. 2012; F\u00c3\u00a4rnegardh M et al. 2003; Lin CY & Gustafsson JA 2015). Although both NR1H3 and NR1H2 are activated by the same ligands and are structurally similar, their tissue expression profiles are very different. NR1H3 is selectively expressed in specific tissues and cell types, such as the liver, intestine, adrenal gland, adipose tissue and macrophages, whereas NR1H2 is ubiquitously expressed (Nishimura M et al. 2004; Bookout AL et al. 2006). Upon activation NR1H2 or NR1H3 heterodimerizes with retinoid X receptors (RXR) and binds to LXR-response elements (LXREs) consisting of a direct repeat of the core sequence 5'-AGGTCA-3' separated by 4 nucleotides (DR4) in the DNA of target genes (Wiebel FF & Gustafsson JA 1997). An inverted repeat of the same consensus sequence with no spacer region(IR-0) and an inverted repeat of the same consensus sequence separated by a 1 bp spacer (IR-1) have also been shown to mediate LXR transactivation (Mak PA et al. 2002, Landrier JF et al. 2003). NR1H3 and NR1H2 have been shown to regulate gene expression via LXREs in the promoter regions of their target genes such as UDP glucuronosyltransferase 1 family, polypeptide A3 (UGT1A3) (Verreault M et al. 2006), fatty acid synthase (FAS) (Joseph SB et al. 2002a), carbohydrate response element binding protein (ChREBP, also known as MLX-interacting protein-like or MLXIPL) (Cha JY & Repa JJ 2007) and phospholipid transfer protein (PLTP) (Mak PA et al. 2002). LXREs have also been reported to be present in introns of target genes such as the ATP-binding cassette transporter G1 (ABCG1) (Sabol SL et al. 2005). NR1H3 has been shown to activate gene expression via the FXR-responsive element found in the proximal promoter of the human ileal bile acid-binding protein (FABP6) (Landrier JF et al. 2003).

The IL-11 signaling pathway is also implicated in the regulation of immune responses, including Th2 polarization in CD4+ T cells. Overall, the interleukin-11 signaling pathway plays a significant role in the regulation of various cellular processes, including hematopoiesis, adipogenesis, and immune responses."}, "WAG002619": {"NAME": "Cannabinoid receptor signaling", "LINK": "https://www.wikipathways.org/index.php/Pathway:WP3869", "WP_ID": "WP3869", "Description": "Endogenous cannabinoid receptors belong to the endocannabinoid system and are located in the mammalian brain and throughout the central and peripheral nervous systems, consisting of neuromodulatory lipids and their receptors. The endocannabinoid system is involved in a variety of physiological processes including appetite, pain-sensation, mood, and memory, and in mediating the psychoactive effects of cannabis. Two primary endocannabinoid receptors have been identified: CNR1 and CNR2. CNR1 is found predominantly in the brain and nervous system, as well as in peripheral organs and tissues, and are the main molecular target of the endocannabinoid ligand (binding molecule), Anandamide, as well as its mimetic phytocannabinoid, THC (tetrahydrocannabinol). One other main endocannabinoid is 2-Arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) which is active at both cannabinoid receptors, along with its own mimetic phytocannabinoid, CBD (cannabidiol). 2-AG and CBD are involved in the regulation of appetite, immune system functions and pain management.\nSource: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocannabinoid_system \n\nNot all MAPK subtypes are relevant for this pathway.

The main endocannabinoids, Anandamide and 2-Arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), interact with these receptors to regulate various functions, including appetite, immune system functions, and pain management. Anandamide primarily targets CNR1, while 2-AG is active at both CNR1 and CNR2. The phytocannabinoids, THC and CBD, mimic the effects of these endocannabinoids, with THC primarily targeting CNR1 and CBD interacting with 2-AG at CNR2.

The lipooxygenase (LOX) pathway is one of the key branches of eicosanoid metabolism, where arachidonic acid is converted into hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (HPETE) by the action of LOX enzymes. This intermediate is then reduced to hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (HETE), which can be further metabolized into various eicosanoids, including leukotrienes and lipoxins. Leukotrienes, such as LTC4, LTD4, and LTE4, are involved in inflammatory responses and are produced by the action of 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) and leukotriene C4 synthase (LTC4S). Lipoxins, on the other hand, are anti-inflammatory mediators that are produced by the action of 12-LOX and 15-LOX. The LOX pathway plays a significant role in various diseases, including asthma, atherosclerosis, and cancer, and is a potential target for the development of new therapeutic agents."}, "WAG001992": {"NAME": "Fatty acid beta-oxidation", "LINK": "https://www.wikipathways.org/index.php/Pathway:WP143", "WP_ID": "WP143", "Description": "Complete fatty acid beta-oxidation pathway for saturated and unsaturated fatty acids.\nProteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP143 CPTAC Assay Portal]", "Disease": "fatty acid metabolism", "Pathway Ontology": "fatty acid degradation pathway && fatty acid metabolic pathway && fatty acid beta degradation pathway", "Summary": "Fatty acid beta-oxidation is a crucial metabolic pathway that breaks down fatty acids into acetyl-CoA units, which can then be fed into the citric acid cycle to produce energy. This process occurs in the mitochondria and involves a series of enzyme-catalyzed reactions that shorten the fatty acid chain by two carbon atoms at a time. The pathway is capable of processing both saturated and unsaturated fatty acids, with the latter requiring specific enzymes to facilitate the removal of double bonds. The key enzymes involved in fatty acid beta-oxidation include acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, enoyl-CoA hydratase, 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase, and thiolytic cleavage enzyme. The pathway is essential for the metabolism of fatty acids, particularly in the heart and muscles, where it provides a significant source of energy.

Mitochondria, often referred to as the powerhouse of the cell, are not only involved in energy production but also in the regulation of cellular stress and immune responses. Upon SARS-CoV-2 infection, mitochondria undergo significant changes, including the release of mitochondrial DNA and the activation of mitochondrial antiviral signaling (MAVS) pathway. The MAVS pathway triggers the production of type I interferons, which are essential for the initiation of antiviral responses. Additionally, mitochondria release reactive oxygen species (ROS) and other signaling molecules that activate immune cells, such as macrophages and T cells, to eliminate infected cells. The mitochondrial immune response also involves the activation of autophagy, a process that degrades damaged or infected cellular components, including mitochondria. This process helps to prevent the spread of the virus and maintain cellular homeostasis. Furthermore, the mitochondrial immune response has been shown to be critical in determining the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection, with impaired mitochondrial function associated with more severe disease outcomes. Overall, the mitochondrial immune response is a vital component of the host's defense against SARS-CoV-2 infection, and its dysregulation can have significant consequences for disease progression and outcome."}}
