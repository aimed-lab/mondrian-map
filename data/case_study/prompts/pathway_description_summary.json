They work by cleaving proteins necessary for the fusion of synaptic vesicles with the plasma membrane, preventing the release of neurotransmitters. The toxins are composed of a heavy chain and a light chain, which remain attached through noncovalent interactions and a disulfide bond. Once ingested, the toxin must be taken up from the gut lumen into the circulation, a process mediated by accessory proteins. The toxin then binds to specific gangliosides or synaptic vesicle proteins on the neuronal plasma membrane and is taken up into synaptic vesicles or clathrin-coated vesicles. Acidification of the vesicles causes a conformational change in the toxin, allowing its heavy chain to function as a channel and its light chain to be extruded into the neuronal cytosol, where it acts as a zinc metalloprotease to cleave specific bonds in proteins on the cytosolic faces of synaptic vesicles and plasma membranes, preventing exocytosis and leading to paralysis.", "WAG002244": "Elastic fibre formation is a complex process that involves the assembly of elastin and microfibrils to provide essential properties of elastic recoil and resilience in dynamic connective tissues. The central cross-linked core of elastin is surrounded by a mesh of microfibrils, primarily composed of fibrillin, with over 30 ancillary proteins involved in mediating roles in elastic fibre assembly and interactions with the surrounding environment. Fibulin-5, for example, plays a crucial role in the formation of elastic fibres by mediating interactions between elastin and fibrillin, and also influences smooth muscle cell proliferation. The assembly of fibrillin into microfibrils involves cell surface structures and the formation of gamma glutamyl epsilon lysine isopeptide bonds and intermolecular disulfide bonds. The N-terminal half of fibrillin-1 is asymmetrically exposed in outer filaments, while the C-terminal half is buried in the interior. Fibrillinopathies, such as Marfan syndrome, are caused by mutations in the fibrillin-1 gene. In vivo assembly of fibrillin requires the presence of extracellular fibronectin fibres, and fibrillins interact with integrins, heparin-binding domains, and proteoglycans to confer specific properties to the extracellular matrix. Elastin is synthesized as a 70kDa monomer called tropoelastin, which is composed largely of hydrophobic domains that alternate along the polypeptide chain. The assembly of elastic fibres involves the deposition of tropoelastin onto a template of fibrillin-rich microfibrils, with the first step being the organization of small globules of elastin on the cell surface followed by globule aggregation into microfibres.

NOTCH3 mutations are also associated with the CADASIL syndrome, a condition characterized by degeneration of vascular smooth muscle cells and an increased risk of stroke.", "WAG002284": "Collagen biosynthesis is a complex, multistep process involving the translation, post-translational modification, and assembly of collagen polypeptide chains. Collagen propeptides are translocated into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen, where they undergo hydroxylation of proline and lysine residues by prolyl 3-, prolyl 4-, and lysyl hydroxylases. This modification is essential for the stability of the triple helical collagenous domain, with approximately 50% of prolines being 4-hydroxylated in fibril-forming collagens. Hydroxylysine molecules can form cross-links between collagen molecules in fibrils and serve as sites for glycosylation and galactosylation. The non-collagenous domains of collagen peptides have regulatory functions, with some being biologically active when cleaved from the main peptide chain. The assembly of collagen molecules involves the formation of intra-chain disulfide bonds, hydroxylation of proline and lysine residues, and the association of individual chains via the C-propeptides or non-collagenous domains. The triple helix then nucleates and folds in a C- to N- direction, and the N-propeptides associate and form inter-chain disulfide bonds. Procollagen is released into the extracellular space, where it undergoes removal of the C- and N-propeptides by metalloproteinases, resulting in the formation of tropocollagen, the unit of higher-order fibrils and fibers. Tropocollagens spontaneously aggregate in vitro, forming fibrils that are stabilized by lysyl oxidase-catalyzed cross-links between adjacent molecules.", "WAG002285": "The cellular response to hypoxia is a critical mechanism that allows cells to adapt to changes in oxygen availability. Under normal oxygen conditions, the transcription factor HIF-alpha is hydroxylated on proline and asparagine residues by specific enzymes, marking it for degradation. This process requires molecular oxygen as a substrate, and the presence of hydroxylated asparagine and proline residues prevents HIF-alpha from interacting with its co-activators. However, in low oxygen conditions, the hydroxylation of HIF-alpha is inhibited, leading to its stabilization and accumulation in the nucleus. Here, HIF-alpha binds to HIF-beta and recruits co-activators such as p300 and CBP to activate the transcription of target genes involved in angiogenesis and erythropoiesis, including EPO and VEGF. This adaptive response enables cells to increase oxygen delivery and promote survival under hypoxic conditions.", "WAG002290": "The regulation of mRNA stability by proteins that bind AU-rich elements is a crucial mechanism in post-transcriptional control of gene expression. AU-rich elements, characterized by their high content of adenine and uracil residues, serve as binding sites for specific proteins. These proteins can either target the associated mRNA for degradation or, in some cases, stabilize it, thereby influencing the levels of the encoded protein. The activity of these AU-element binding proteins is tightly regulated, primarily through phosphorylation, which can modulate their ability to bind to AU-rich elements. Additionally, the subcellular localization of these proteins can also impact their function, allowing for precise control over mRNA stability and translation. This regulatory mechanism plays a significant role in various cellular processes, including cell growth, differentiation, and response to stress, and is often dysregulated in diseases such as cancer.", "WAG002291": "The RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK pathway is a crucial signaling cascade that regulates various cellular processes, including proliferation, differentiation, survival, senescence, and cell motility, in response to growth factors, hormones, and cytokines. This pathway is initiated when stimuli bind to receptors in the plasma membrane, leading to the activation of RAS through GEF-mediated activation. Activated RAS recruits and activates RAF, which in turn phosphorylates and activates MEK proteins, which then phosphorylate and activate ERK proteins. ERK proteins can dimerize and have targets in both the nucleus and cytosol, and their activation can lead to changes in cellular behavior. The RAS/RAF MAPK cascade is activated from various intracellular locations and its temporal and spatial specificity is achieved through interactions with scaffolding proteins. This pathway is significant due to the high frequency of mutations in its components in human cancers, with activating mutations in RAS found in approximately one third of human cancers and activated BRAF found in around 8% of tumors.", "WAG002292": "Insulin processing is a complex pathway that involves the generation of insulin-containing secretory granules from proinsulin in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The process begins with the transcription of the human insulin gene, activated by transcription factors such as Pdx-1, MafA, Beta2/NeuroD1, and E47, which interact synergistically to promote transcription in response to glucose. The preproinsulin mRNA is translated into proinsulin, which then undergoes intramolecular disulfide bond formation in the ER, facilitated by the oxidizing environment. Proinsulin then moves to the Golgi Complex, where it forms complexes with zinc and calcium, and is cleaved by endoproteases to yield mature insulin and the C peptide. The insulin-containing secretory granules are then translocated across the cytosol to the plasma membrane, where they are docked and ready for exocytosis in response to glucose or other secretagogues. Exocytosis is a calcium-dependent process, facilitated by the interaction of SNARE-type proteins and the calcium-binding membrane protein Synaptotagmin V/IX. The mature insulin is then released into the bloodstream, where it plays a crucial role in regulating glucose metabolism.", "WAG002295": "Glycerophospholipids are crucial components of biological membranes, serving as structural and functional elements, as well as precursors to lipid mediators such as platelet-activating factor and eicosanoids. These lipids are composed of various types, including phosphatidic acid, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylinositol, cardiolipin, lysophosphatidic acid, and lysobisphosphatidic acid. The biosynthesis of glycerophospholipids begins with the de novo pathway, which utilizes fatty acids activated as acyl-CoA donors. However, the acyl groups of glycerophospholipids are highly diverse and distributed asymmetrically, with saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids typically esterified at the sn-1 position and polyunsaturated acyl groups at the sn-2 position. Subsequent acyl chain remodeling generates the diverse glycerophospholipid composition and asymmetry characteristic of cell membranes. The de novo pathway involves the conversion of glycerol 3-phosphate to lysophosphatidic acid, which is then converted to phosphatidic acid, diacylglycerol, and other glycerol derivatives. These derivatives are further processed into various glycerophospholipids, including phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylinositol, and cardiolipin. Each glycerophospholipid is involved in acyl chain remodeling via cleavage by phospholipases followed by reacylation by an acyltransferase. Glycerophospholipids are synthesized in various membrane compartments, including the endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, and endosomes, and are transported between these compartments via various mechanisms, including diffusion, transportation complexes, and membrane contact sites.", "WAG002296": "Inositol phosphate metabolism plays a crucial role in eukaryotic signalling processes. The six-carbon cyclic alcohol myo-inositol is the foundation for a wide variety of signalling entities, generated through mono-, di-, and triphosphorylation of the inositol ring. Key molecules, such as inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (I(1,4,5)P3), are formed through the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) by phospholipase C. These molecules are then acted upon by various kinases and phosphatases in the cytosol and nucleus, producing a range of inositol trisphosphate, tetrakisphosphate, pentakisphosphate, hexakisphosphate, heptakisphosphate, and octakisphosphate molecules. These nuclear-produced IPs can transport back to the cytosol, where they are further converted by kinases and phosphatases, resulting in an even wider variety of IPs, including di- and triphospho inositol phosphates. This complex network of inositol phosphate metabolism is essential for regulating various cellular processes, including cell growth, differentiation, and survival.", "WAG002297": "The TGF-beta/BMP signaling pathway is a complex network that plays a crucial role in controlling embryonic and adult cell proliferation and differentiation. Upon binding of a ligand to the TGF-beta receptor complex, a phosphorylated receptor SMAD (R-SMAD) is activated, which then promotes transcription in the nucleus in complex with a helper molecule, Co-SMAD (SMAD4). This R-SMAD:Co-SMAD complex interacts with various transcriptional co-activators and co-repressors to regulate the expression of effector genes, depending on the cell type and cross-talk with other signaling pathways. The pathway is involved in numerous biological processes and is implicated in various human diseases. The signaling process is tightly regulated by negative feedback loops, including the ubiquitination and degradation of R-SMADs and the TGF-beta receptor complex, as well as the transcription of inhibitory SMADs (I-SMADs). The balance of these regulatory mechanisms allows the pathway to respond to different cellular contexts and adapt to changing conditions.", "WAG002298": "Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are long, unbranched polysaccharides composed of a repeating disaccharide unit containing a hexosamine and a uronic acid, often heavily sulfated. They are primarily found in the extracellular matrix and on cell membranes, where they act as a lubricating fluid for joints and participate in signaling processes. GAGs have structural roles in connective tissue, cartilage, bone, and blood vessels. They are degraded in the lysosome as part of their natural turnover, and defects in lysosomal enzymes responsible for GAG metabolism lead to lysosomal storage diseases called mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS). MPSs are characterized by the accumulation of GAGs in lysosomes, resulting in chronic, debilitating disorders that can lead to severe psychomotor retardation and premature death. The breakdown and biosynthesis of main GAGs, including hyaluronate, keratan sulfate, chondroitin sulfate, dermatan sulfate, and heparan sulfate, are critical for maintaining tissue structure and function.", "WAG002299": "Erythrocytes play a crucial role in regulating the body's acid-base balance and facilitating oxygen delivery to tissues. Carbon dioxide in plasma is converted into protons and bicarbonate by carbonic anhydrase enzymes located on the surface of endothelial cells and within erythrocytes. The bicarbonate is then transported out of the erythrocyte by the band 3 anion exchange protein, while the protons bind to histidine residues in hemoglobin (HbA), causing a conformational change that reduces HbA's affinity for oxygen. This process, known as the Bohr effect, enables the release of oxygen to tissues. Additionally, carbon dioxide within erythrocytes combines with the N-terminal alpha amino groups of HbA to form carbamates, further contributing to the regulation of oxygen delivery. This complex interplay of enzymes and proteins ensures efficient gas exchange and maintains the body's acid-base balance.", "WAG002300": "The B cell receptor (BCR) signaling pathway is a crucial mechanism by which mature B cells respond to antigens. The BCR complex, composed of immunoglobulins (IgM and IgD) and Ig-alpha and Ig-beta subunits, is activated upon antigen binding, triggering a cascade of phosphorylation events. Src family tyrosine kinases, including LYN, FYN, and BLK, phosphorylate immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) in the cytoplasmic tails of Ig-alpha and Ig-beta. This leads to the activation of the protein kinase SYK, which binds to the phosphorylated ITAMs and undergoes autophosphorylation. Activated SYK and other kinases then phosphorylate scaffolding proteins, such as BLNK, BCAP, and CD19, which assemble large signaling complexes, or signalosomes. These complexes recruit and activate various effectors, including phosphoinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), phospholipase C gamma (PLC-gamma), and NCK.

The resulting signaling events ultimately lead to the activation of B cells and the initiation of an immune response.", "WAG002301": "Phosphatidylinositol (PI) metabolism involves the reversible phosphorylation of PI at the 3, 4, and 5 positions of the inositol ring to generate seven phosphoinositides, which are heterogeneously distributed within cells. These phosphoinositides serve as signature components of different intracellular compartment membranes, mediating specificity of membrane interactions. Phosphoinositide levels are tightly regulated by various kinases and phosphatases, ensuring maintenance of their heterogeneous distribution. PI is primarily synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum and exported to other compartments via membrane traffic or cytosolic phospholipid transfer proteins. Phosphorylation of PI to PI4P occurs in the Golgi, where it plays a crucial role in the biogenesis of transport vesicles and acts as a precursor to PI(4,5)P2. PI(4,5)P2 is a key regulator of cell surface proteins, a precursor for second messengers, and a cofactor for actin nucleation. At the plasma membrane, PI(4,5)P2 is further phosphorylated to PI(3,4,5)P3, which stimulates cell survival and proliferation. The inositol 3-phosphatase PTEN regenerates PI(4,5)P2, while 5-phosphatases convert PI(3,4,5)P3 into PI(3,4)P2, propagating the signal initiated by PI(3,4,5)P3. PI(3,4)P2 is further dephosphorylated in the endocytic pathway to PI3P, the signature phosphoinositide of the early endosomal compartment. The subsequent endosomal phosphorylation of PI3P to PI(3,5)P2 generates docking sites for recruitment of cytosolic factors responsible for controlling outgoing traffic from the endosomes.", "WAG002302": "The LKB1-AMPK pathway plays a crucial role in regulating the mTOR signaling pathway, which is essential for cellular energy homeostasis and growth. When the cellular energy status is low, the LKB1 complex, consisting of LKB1, STRAD, and MO25, is activated. This activation leads to the phosphorylation and activation of AMPK, a key energy sensor. In response to high AMP:ATP ratios, AMPK inhibits the dephosphorylation of itself, maintaining its activation. Activated AMPK then phosphorylates and activates the TSC complex, which in turn activates the intrinsic GTPase activity of Rheb. This results in GDP-loaded Rheb, which inhibits the mTOR pathway, preventing excessive protein synthesis and promoting energy conservation. The LKB1-AMPK pathway thus acts as a critical regulator of the mTOR pathway, ensuring that cellular energy status is maintained and growth is coordinated with energy availability.", "WAG002304": "Adipogenesis is the process of cell differentiation by which preadipocytes become adipocytes. During this process, preadipocytes cease to proliferate, accumulate lipid droplets, and develop morphologic and biochemical characteristics of mature adipocytes. The process is controlled by a cascade of transcription factors, with CCAAT/Enhancer Binding Protein Beta (CEBPB) and CCAAT/Enhancer Binding Protein Delta (CEBPD) being among the first to be induced. These transcription factors activate the Peroxisome Proliferator-activated Receptor Gamma (PPARG) gene, which encodes a type II nuclear hormone receptor that forms a heterodimer with the Retinoid X Receptor Alpha (RXRA). The PPARG:RXRA heterodimer binds to specific DNA sequences and regulates the expression of genes involved in differentiation, fatty acid transport, carbohydrate metabolism, and energy homeostasis. PPARG targets include genes such as aP2/FABP4, LPL, and LEPTIN. The self-reinforcing loop between PPARG and CEBPA maintains PPARG expression and the differentiated state, with PPARG activating CEBPA and CEBPA activating PPARG.

These molecules are recognized by pathogen- or pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs), including the Toll-like receptor family and the nucleotide-binding domain, leucine rich repeat containing receptors (NLRs). NLRs, also known as NOD-like receptors, recognize PAMPs/DAMPs from phagocytosed microorganisms or from intracellular infections, and are involved in processes unrelated to pathogen detection, such as tissue homeostasis, apoptosis, and early development. Structurally, NLRs can be subdivided into the caspase-recruitment domain (CARD)-containing NLRCs and the pyrin domain (PYD)-containing NLRPs. Most NLRs have a tripartite structure consisting of a variable amino-terminal domain, a central nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain, and a carboxy-terminal leucine-rich repeat that detects PAMPs/DAMPs. Under resting conditions, NLRs are thought to be present in an autorepressed form, with the LRR folded back onto the NACHT domain preventing oligomerization.

The conjugation of ubiquitin chains to RIPK1 allows the recruitment and activation of the TAK1 and IKK complexes, promoting cell survival by inducing anti-apoptotic proteins and pro-inflammatory cytokines. However, when the survival pathway is inhibited, the TRADD:TRAF2:RIPK1 complex recruits FADD and procaspase-8, leading to the initiation of apoptotic cell death. Under certain conditions, deubiquitinated RIPK1 is engaged by RIPK3, forming the necrosome, a necroptosis-inducing complex. The TNF-alpha-induced TNFR1 activation also leads to the activation of sphingomyelinase, resulting in the production of ceramide, which induces anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic responses. The ceramide can be converted into sphingosine-1-phosphate, which exerts cytoprotective signaling to promote cell growth. The TNF-alpha signaling pathway provides highly specific cell responses initiated by various types of stimuli, with extensive cross-talk between pro-apoptotic/necroptotic and other NFkappaB and MAPK pathways.", "WAG002458": "The mismatch repair (MMR) system is a highly conserved pathway across prokaryotes and eukaryotes, primarily associated with DNA replication. It corrects single base mismatches and small insertion and deletion loops by detecting and repairing errors in newly synthesized DNA. The pathway involves a sensor, such as a MutS homologue, that detects mismatches and activates a set of proteins, including a MutL homologue and an exonuclease, to select the nascent DNA strand for repair. The MutS complex, consisting of MSH2:MSH6 or MSH2:MSH3 heterodimers, recognizes and binds to mismatches, becoming activated in an ATP-dependent manner. This allows for subsequent interactions with MLH1:PMS2, PCNA, and other proteins to initiate excision of the recently replicated strand and direct DNA polymerase delta to replace the mismatched bases. The process involves the removal of a single-stranded gap by exonuclease activity, followed by the synthesis of a new strand by DNA polymerase delta and the sealing of the remaining nick by DNA ligase I. Defects in MMR proteins, such as MSH2, MSH6, MLH1, and PMS2, can lead to hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC), also known as Lynch syndrome.

WAVEs, on the other hand, form a regulatory complex with other proteins and are activated by the binding of RAC1:GTP, which induces a conformational change and enables their activating phosphorylation. This activation allows WAVEs to function as nucleation promoting factors in actin polymerization, highlighting their importance in various cellular processes, including cell migration, endocytosis, and cytokinesis.", "WAG002462": "Bacillus anthracis bacteria infect human cells through the action of three secreted proteins: lethal factor (LF), edema factor (EF), and protective antigen (PA). Lethal factor is a protease that inactivates many MAP kinase kinase proteins, disrupting signaling pathways. Edema factor is an adenylate cyclase that causes the constitutive production of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), a molecule normally generated in tightly regulated amounts in response to extracellular signals. Both lethal factor and edema factor depend on protective antigen to enter target cells. Protective antigen binds to cell receptors, is cleaved, and forms an oligomer that exposes binding sites for lethal factor and edema factor molecules. This complex is taken into the target cell by endocytosis and delivered to endosomes, where the low pH causes the bacterial toxin complex to rearrange and form a pore in the endosome membrane, allowing lethal factor and edema factor to enter the target cell cytosol. This process ultimately disrupts normal cellular functions and contributes to the pathogenesis of anthrax infection.", "WAG002466": "The heat shock response is a conserved cellular mechanism that allows cells to recover from protein damage induced by stress, such as elevated temperature, hypoxia, and free radicals.

Upon engulfment, microorganisms are exposed to a series of host defense mechanisms, including the production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS and RNS) by specialized enzymes. NADPH oxidase produces superoxide radical anion and hydrogen peroxide, while induced NO synthase generates nitric oxide, the primary source of RNS. The phagocyte NADPH oxidase and iNOS are expressed in both PMN and mononuclear phagocytes, with neutrophils producing significantly more ROS and macrophages producing more RNS. The presence of ROS and RNS has a relatively low reactivity, but can initiate a cascade of reactions to generate more damaging \"secondary\" species, such as hydroxyl radical and peroxynitrite, which are extremely toxic and cause irreversible damage to biomolecules. The phagosome undergoes extensive maturation, involving membrane remodeling and luminal content changes, to become a microbicidal organelle. Macrophages and neutrophils exhibit differences in phagocytosis and phagosomal maturation, with macrophages forming a phagolysosome through membrane fission/fusion events and neutrophils delivering antimicrobial substances from preformed granules. The microbicidal activity of macrophages is characterized by progressive acidification of the phagosome, while neutrophil phagosomes exhibit early alkalization followed by gradual acidification.
