## Version 1.1.1 Security Updates (2024-06-17)

### Application Security
- File uploads are now sanitized: only .csv files with safe names are accepted
- Uploaded CSVs are validated for required columns (GS_ID, wFC, pFDR, x, y)
- Invalid or unsafe files are rejected with user-friendly warnings
- Input validation is performed on all uploaded data

### Script Security & Robustness
- Unix/macOS and Windows run scripts now check for Streamlit installation
- Scripts automatically find an available port and clean up old processes
- User-friendly error messages for missing dependencies or port conflicts

### Usage Notes
- Use `./scripts/run_streamlit.sh` (Unix/macOS) or `scripts\run_streamlit_win.bat` (Windows) to launch the app safely
- If you encounter errors, check the troubleshooting section in the README
